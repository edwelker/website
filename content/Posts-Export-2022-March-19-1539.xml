For the moment, I've decided to go with this theme... I like the yellow, and its fairly simple.  Simple is good. I don't like the long lines of text, but if you want something done right, gotta do it yourself.

More later!]]></Content>

		<Title>blog software</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[Upon seeing a few different write-ups in the last few days (that I stumbled upon without searching for), I think that I'm going to [already] change this blog software to <a href="http://expressionengine.com/">ExpressionEngine</a>, which I hear is the most customizable tool out there.  It's not that I am planning on doing crazy design things here, but I would like the chance.  We'll see what the programmer in me says when I see it.

I did find a tool called <a href="http://21degrees.com.au/">Symphony</a> that sounds rather interesting, and it uses XSLTs for the backend (somehow).  Since I have been learning XSLTs at work, I am probably going to give that a look as well.  Plus I like the musical reference.

Was going to do this yesterday, but my sister got her hands on free Nationals tickets.  Boring game until the 8th, when they hit 2 HRs (Dimitri Young was one!), but then stupid Kerns got caught off second on a fly ball to right.  Way to go.]]></Content>

		<Content><![CDATA[I created a fresh installation and played around with it for a little while.  Upon moving these Wordpress posts over, it broke.  Since I still had all of my pieces lined up, I removed everything and did a second fresh install.  Posting broke that one too.  I guess that I am going to have to actually watch the videos on the website to figure out what is going on.  (I hate having to read the manual!  I'd much rather just start playing with it.)

That being said, it did seem pretty nice.  Looks like little pieces of html/css can be specified for each component you are placing on the page.  True to their what I have heard, you can customize everything this way.  The downside is it takes a lot of work and planning to customize EVERYTHING.   Add to that the <a href="http://expressionengine.com/docs/quick_reference.html">{template syntax}</a> and it looks like quite a bit of work.  We'll see how much time I have given all of the other stuff I am working on.

I placed an order today and should receive $200 worth of books from amazon sometime soon.  <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/BTLS/">Programming</a>, <a href="http://archive.eiffel.com/doc/oosc/">OOP</a>, <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=V9UggL60zDMC&amp;dq=design+for+communication+resnick&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=web&amp;ots=BAncFWOgub&amp;sig=ctgpjJne3kjZsruXzjqLG-1iTXs">design</a>, and <a href="http://www.typebooks.org/r-elements.htm">typography</a>, and <a href="http://microformats.org/">that Microformats book</a>.  Those, and the other books sitting on my shelves waiting to be read should be more than enough light reading for a while.]]></Content>

		<Title>Moving, but not yet</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[I am trying hard to find a new place in Bethesda, but everything is so expensive... if only they would <a href="http://www.innerpurpleline.org/">start the purple line</a>, life would be much easier.  I'd still be trying to move regardless, but life would be easier.  Ideal location would be on 185 (Conn. Ave) near the beltway so I can jump right on to get to Monday night orchestra rehearsals, as well as riding my bike to work.  We'll see.

I've been avoiding riding my bike to the metro and taking that, because I can reduce my commute time from 3 hours to 1 or less by driving.  That, and oh yea... someone got shot recently on the path I took every day this past year.  This is after the random stabbing.  Not going to be going that way anytime soon.

I do need to get back out riding, however.  I may have to start going elsewhere... or even driving to a spot to start.  Thats a lot of effort... not sure I am up for that.]]></Content>

		<Title>IE 6 background flicker problem revisited</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[So I fell into the (now famous to me) Internet Explorer 6 background-image flicker problem.  Oh, fun times.  There have been a few different solutions presented, ranging from <a href="http://evil.che.lu/2006/9/25/no-more-ie6-background-flicker">javascript</a> to <a href="http://dean.edwards.name/my/flicker.html">server settings</a> (or my favorite [sarcasm], to put the background-image on a copy of itself so you don't see the flicker). The problem is that I was using a pre-SP1 IE, so the javascript solution wouldn't work, and I did not have access to the server.

After my testing, I've found that the statement of the problem isn't quite correct.  Most say that is whenever you put a background-image style on a link.  This isn't quite accurate.  The problem I have observed is:

<p class="pullquote"><em>When a background-image style is applied to either a DOM element with an event attached to it, or to any of its children.</em></p>
This makes it a wider problem than I had originally thought.  The one caveat I have found is that an inline event (for example, an 'onclick' attribute written in the &lt;element&gt;) will not trigger this effect.

The thing that amazes me about this, and worries me about those trying to apply a duplicate background-image to hide the flicker, is that every mouseover is causing another server hit for that image.  It seems incredible that individuals and companies can just turn a blind eye to this.  I would be inclined to send Microsoft an invoice...

<em>Postscript:</em> I used <a href="http://www.fiddlertool.com/fiddler/">Fiddler</a> which was a really big help testing for this.  Turns out it is owned by Microsoft.  Anyone sensing any guilt there???]]></Content>

I'm happy that they distanced themselves from the Yankees, and that their bats heated up before heading into New York.   This series, however, was eerily similar to the 5 game series where the Yankees swept the Red Sox last August, so I can't get particularly excited about it.  Chicago deserved better.]]></Content>

		<Title>Beginning of the fall semester</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[Tomorrow is the start of a new <a href="http://www.columbiaorchestra.org">Columbia Orchestra</a> season.  It's the first rehearsal.  I could not be less prepared either.  For the first time I can remember, I am starting a new semester and nothing in my life is changing.  I don't have a new place to live, any new classes, any new books/clothes/shoes for school, or even any new school.

At this time last year I was about to return from East Hampton.  I was moving into a new house, one I had never seen, and was about to start searching for a new job.  It was exciting.  From almost nowhere, I decided I was going to get a job writing webpages, or programming, or both.  I wrote up a resume, replied to a few postings, and got a temp job.  I was offered a regular position within a week-and-a-half and have been doin' it since.

As an aside, I believe I've come a long way.  First, I've made many new friends, and have been many new places doing many new things.  It has been a lot of fun.  I have taken my HTML &amp; CSS from zero-to-sixty, learned a ton of Javascript and Rails, and am now looking into usability, design patterns, graphic design, typography, algorithms and more.  And I pick up things very quickly, and hope to get even faster.

But back to the semester starting, I've got my usual panic.  End of summer.  Start of fall.  Baseball, hot days, and lazy weekends are all winding down.  Football, brisk breezes, and rehearsals all starting.  Time for something big and new.  I just have to figure out what that is going to be this year.]]></Content>

		<Content><![CDATA[I love ems. I set values (using hundredths) like 2.15em regularly. It would seem, however, that Opera 9 either calculates this value differently or rounds up the calculated value. I've done a bit of testing today, and adjusted a number of heights which weren't visually aligned to other things. I used the @media and ~ hack to set a smaller length for Opera 9. I'll have to investigate this further.]]></Content>

		<Title>My new look on old characters</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[I don't know much about typography.  I find the subject absolutely interesting, especially from a historical perspective, but I think I am slightly intimidated by it too.  It has thousands of years of history, and more than a few books I have read tell me that "the rules in use today were perfected hundreds of years ago."  I imagine a disciple of Gutenburg, wearing funny little shoes, leaning over and whispering, "yea, hundreds of years... don't mess it up!" into my ear.

So I try not to mess it up.  I take it slowly.  I've read a few books.  I've ordered what I hear is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elements_of_Typographic_Style">the typography bible</a>, but it deserves my undivided attention, so it is still sitting sealed in cellophane on my shelves.  The things that I don't know about typography could undoubtedly fill many, many shelves.  That's why it is always fun to learn something new.  And I did today, reading one of the most interesting posts I have seen in a while.

I won't repeat it as you can <a href="http://technicalpoet.com/2007/08/30/the-interaction-design-of-typography/">read it yourself</a>.Â  However, in this post Mrs. Simmons mentions how common type may be considered almost as a means for wiping out a local dialect.Â  I find that intriguing alone. She goes on to argue, however, that the common symbols further enhance the language of design.  Knowing only what I currently do on the subject, I both see her point, and find the thought eye-opening.  It is yet another facet of the work that I do day-in-day-out but know virtually nothing about.  It is amazing how every large scale object is made up from small atom-like parts. Tomorrow I will go in and look at a word, a sentence, a paragraph, or even a single letter in a new way.Â  Of course, this means I am going to have to unwrap that book sooner than anticipated.Â  But this is useful information, I've already thought of an instance where I can apply this new knowledge.  But I'm not sharing... I don't want to mess anything up.

Anyway, thanks to <a href="http://www.technicalpoet.com/about">Amber Simmons</a>, who made me think of things differently today, and probably tomorrow too.]]></Content>

		<Title>Minor design update</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[So I tweaked the CSS and arrived at this.  I kinda like it.  It reminds me of a pair of eighties boating shorts, not quite sure why. It isn't the most pleasing design, but that is intentional. Clean wasn't the goal, I was aiming for something more... me.  Well, enough me as CSS can produce.  (I think I just said I'm like CSS boating shorts...weird)  I'm a strong believer that all comps should be done in Photoshop, where you have a freedom that CSS doesn't allow. Then you take the comp and cut it up using good CSS and HTML.  I didn't do any of that.Â  This was just a tweak, and a tweak on a whim at that.

Anyway,  I will try to start a more formal "design" soon, but not likely before I start moving.]]></Content>

Getting away from all this traffic and signing the lease to my new place today. Woo hoo! Or at least I think woo hoo.

Not going to start moving in yet, because I have a month overlap to do that.

Slightly scared, however, that I am looking forward to going back there so I can re-evaluate the place in my mind... for size and things like that. Shouldn't I know that beforehand? Oh well.

7pm... and counting.]]></Content>

		<Title>Pushing Browsers</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[So I have been working on a small piece of navigation at work.  Tabs, to be exact.  Multiple items, but no more than 5 at a time.  Variable length titles (including some rather long).  As it is a list of links, of course, I wanted to use an unordered list.  It all made perfect semantic sense.  Just spit out the list, add some CSS for the tab look, and done.

However, there were requirements for its behavior.  The tabs were not allowed to wrap around to the next line.  They also could not just drift off the right side of the page.  Everything had to be shown.  And it was alright for the individual tabs to wrap and grow taller.  Basically, I was told the nav had to act like a table, just not in so many words.

Because I am likely more standards-driven than most doing similar work, I wanted to stick with the list.  Doesn't make any sense to have non-tabular data in a table, I thought. Within a few minutes, I had found a semi-solution. W3C recommends the display attribute having a "table-cell" property, which was just what I was looking for.  Threw it in my code, hit reload in Firefox, and wham, there it was.  Needed a slight bit of tweaking, but it was working for the most part.  Then I alt-tab'bed over to IE7....

Nothing.

Low and behold, Microsoft hasn't added that to IE.  Of course not.  Why would they?  It's only been <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-CSS2-19980512/">in the recommendation since... you know, May 1998</a>.  At least!  (I don't have the heart to look any further back).

I am not "new" as my sister would say... I know how it is.  I hadn't expected it to be there, but the more work I had to do on an alternate table-based solution, the more it annoyed me.  I keep hearing more and more about the CSS3 recommendation, adding more elements to HTML 5, and all of these other grand documents, which all currently amount to little-to-nothing.  Maybe I am missing the point, but if 1998 is going to be ignored, why should 2008 be any different?

I am going to keep this rant short, the rant wasn't really the point.  The greater point is that was enough of a call-to-action for me.  That's what it took to realize I should start looking into what I can do about giving certain browsers a push in the right direction.Â  They seem to be lost.]]></Content>

		<Title>CSS Shorthand Cheat Sheet</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[If there is one thing that I'm a sucker for, it's cheat sheets.  I love letting my eyes fall upon a single page and navigate right to what I'm looking for.  It takes the whole "open book, locate index, look up word, find page, find where on page" process out and beats it with a big stick.

So the other day I was working on some trivial CSS, and found myself having to look up the shorthand for 'list-style' for the millionth time. I don't know what in my childhood prevents me from remembering it, but... it must have been traumatic. Anyway, I looked over at my <a href="http://www.ilovejackdaniels.com/cheat-sheets/css-cheat-sheet/">CSS cheat sheet</a>, and it was absent.  So I searched the webbernet for a cheat sheet.  I found <a href="http://www.dustindiaz.com/css-shorthand/">Dustin Diaz's guide</a>, but that wasn't what I was looking for.  It was filled with information, however I know the valuesâ€“I work with them constantly.  I just wanted to figure out the order and defaults... and put them on the wall.

<a href="http://edwardwelker.com/2007/09/06/css-shorthand-cheat-sheet/css-shorthand-cheat-sheet/" rel="attachment wp-att-24" title="CSS Shorthand Cheat Sheet">So here is my CSS Shorthand Cheat Sheet</a>.

This cheat sheet contains all of the cases (that I can think of) where a CSS property has a shorthand notation.  I've even added the obscure and rarely implemented <em>outline</em> and outline variations, as well as the Aural <em>pause</em> and <em>cue</em> properties (respecting accessibility).  I even threw in the color shortcut (#abc) in for good measure.  :)

From a design perspective, there is obvious room for improvement. I haven't really messed with InDesign since it was called Pagemaker, and I was doing my high-school newspaper.  So that was interesting.  I also wanted the design to look slightly disorganized... anyone who's ever seen my yellow shoes will know why. There are saturated colors, but no heavy backgrounds.  I wanted it to be printed, and I only have a grayscale laserjet printer.  While on the subject, it looks somewhat faded when printed. I have to look into adjusting the colors for priting grayscale, but I'd prefer not to darken all of them.

Anyway, I hope that someone will find it helpful.  I'm going to use it tomorrow.]]></Content>

		<Title>blurry focus</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[I've been working on the same project for about 4 weeks now.  4 weeks straight.  It's the re-design of certain parts of <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez/">a big site</a> using CSS.  Sounds like nothing, but the constraints of the re-design are that it must function almost exactly like the old.  Therein lies the difficulty.

It is surprisingly hard to make the new act like the old.  I am pretty good with my CSS, but when you have different parts that can expand to huge sizes, both horizontally and vertically, it is quite the challenge.  Also, when certain expections have been set by use of tables, it is hard to design around them.  There is only one widely supported html tag which can resize a collection of block-level elements similarly, and that would be a table.  And yes, I have had to revert to a few tables (with some <em>crazy</em> CSS trickery on top).

I have found myself longing for Microsoft to catch up to other browsers, specifically regarding support of <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/pr_class_display.asp">display: table* attributes</a>, but I'm not really sure why I even <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2006/08/22/712830.aspx">looked</a>.

Aside from the technical difficulties, my main problem as of late has been focus.  I have focused so long and intensely on this one project, it is beginning to blur together.  Today I was making mistakes in my code that I would have never normally made.  And I had to think...for a rather long time about a conceptual problem concerning whether a certain piece of code should be put in an include, or in the calling source.

I guess I don't really know how "long" is "long" to be working on a project.  Something I will have to figure out gradually, I assume.  I am glad to be able to recognize the problem, as I can now see if I can work on de-bluring my vision of the project.  Maybe it simply requires a different perspective.  That being said, one approach that I will take before anything else is to get a good long night's sleep tonight.]]></Content>

		<Title>95% done moving</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[I moved most of the large items this weekend.  I still have a few odds and ends (less than one car-full) left at the house.  One more trip, and then one trip to wash the carpets, and I should be fully vacated from the old location, and fully "in" the new.  Of course, everything remains in boxes, and finding anything is near impossible (and dangerous if you've got to walk over things), but I'm workin' on it.

I'm mostly just interested in getting back into a regular routine.

On the upside (and on a side-note), the Red Sox beat the A's tonight, the Yankees lost, and Manny played his first game in the last 24 days.  Papi hit a home run... hopefully the Sox are using these last few to secure the division, go for best record in the A.L., and win some "meaningful games" before the playoffs start.  Get ready...]]></Content>

		<Title>catching up</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[This is my appropriately named "catching up" post.Â  As most know, I've moved over the last month.Â  Despite my early action, I still had to do a lot of work at the end of the month.Â  C'est la vie, that's what moving is.Â  Aside that, I've also been focused on various work related things (css, xslt, and the "portal" system), as well as the end of baseball's regular season and the beginning of the post season.

On my list of things to touch in full... 1) Advanced DOM Scripting.Â  I finished the book (a while ago) but haven't had a chance to review it yet.Â  At the risk of ruining the surprise for my one (hopefully) reader, it was teriffic, and I highly recommend it. Â  I will do a full write-up later.Â  2) My comments on The Little Schemer.Â  This is simply an amazing book that's opened up a number of paths in my brain.Â  I'm afraid that any review wouldn't do it justice.Â  Maybe some thoughts on the book everyone should read. 3) Random thoughts on Bethesda, Kensington, Rockville (my new home!), riding my bike again, the Tchaikovsky concert coming up, my xslt class coming up, my recent css exploits... as you can see, I've got a lot of things that I am thinking about, but nothing to put down on paper... yet.Â  (Yes, I know, really, there is no paper... shut up!)

Contrast that with the time that I MUST spend with friends, and the potential Boston trip coming up... and I've got a lot to do!!Â  Better get started.Â  Washing my clothes now...]]></Content>

		<Title>RSS newsreaders</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[I am a big fan of Sage, the RSS newsreader plugin for Firefox.Â  In my move, I have tried a few other apps that I thought would be a little better at handling the on-again, off-again nature of me checking my favorite feeds.

I tried <a href="http://www.vienna-rss.org/">Vienna for mac</a>, as it was free, and it worked on my laptop (since I had already packed up the other computers).Â  I liked it fair enough.Â  One of my problems was the keystrokes required to mark all the posts in one feed read, but... aside from that, I had no real problem.Â  (I learned a trick though, the listed keystroke is apple-shift-k, but really, all you have to press is k by itself!Â  Useful, but still on the right hand side... not ergonomic enough.)

Since the PC was the first computer unpacked other than the laptop, I thought that I would give a windows reader a try.Â  I settled on <a href="http://www.newsgator.com/Individuals/FeedDemon/Default.aspx">FeedDemon</a>.Â  I like the stuff it does on its own... the type of display, the checking, and the default behavior of folders.Â  The thing I can not stand is the poor usability of the application.Â  The keystroke for marking all feeds in a folder as read is fairly similar to the browser reload... it's control-shift-r.Â  My brain defaults to that occasionally.Â  The real problem is that it has a separate keystroke for marking all posts in one feed as read, which is control-shift-a.Â  Well, as my brain is hardwired for r, I have pressed that on more than one occasion when trying to mark all posts in a feed as read.Â  What does this do?Â  Well, it marks all posts in the folder I am in as read... and since I imported an OPML feed, it marks all of my feeds as read!!!Â  I've already done that at least 5 times.Â  Yes, it is trivial in the grand scheme of life, death, and taxes, but not insignificant for me.

I think that I am likely to go back to Vienna for the moment, with SharpReader (oldie with no bells-or-whistles, but it works the way I would expect) at work.Â  If Vienna can't convince me pretty soon, I may have to go back to Sage.Â  (Further stating what a great plugin it is).]]></Content>

		<Title>Concert Tonight</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[I've got a concert tongiht. <a href="http://columbiaorchestra.org/" target="_blank">Check out the Columbia Orchestra site for details</a>.  Tchaikovsky 4, along with Strauss' first Horn Concerto, and a Brandenburg.  Should be pretty good, especially since I've practiced a fair amount for this.

I don't expect anyone I know to come, as there is also something going on in Boston tonight.  Some sort of baseball game?

So yea, come and see me torn.  Don't expect me to hang around after the concert for any more than a second though.]]></Content>

		<Title>Game 7: I think Kenny Lofton was out at second</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[From the views that you will see on all of the replays, you will see Kenny Lofton's hand getting to the bag before Pedroia's tag touches him.  That I will give you.  However, from my view point, the point at which  the Indians left fielder was out was AFTER that... when his hands both came up off the bag, and I could see no part of him touching second base.  His hands shot over the base, and because he doesn't weigh 300 pounds, his chest was not touching the bag.

I would like to see another view, and will be the first to admit that I may be biased.  I tried watching it on Sportscenter, but they cut away before you could see his hands leave the bag.  Objectively, however, I believe that the umpire could have seen this, and that would be the basis of the call.  His hand was in there first, but did he stay on the base?  I think not.

Regardless, it was a teriffic play by Manny.Â  Despite stupid Tim McCarver's near constant (and just plain wrong) assertions that Manny may as well be playing without a glove, he made yet another great play off the wall because of his expert knowledge (and regular practice!) on the wall in left.Â  I am thrilled that they are going to the series.  Leave it to me to travel up there to see the one game they lose at home.  But I wouldn't have missed it for the world.]]></Content>

		<Title>XSLT Class</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[Last Monday through last Wednesday I attended <a href="http://mulberrytech.com/">Mulberry Technologies' XSLT course</a>.  I had a fun time, and learned a bunch.

To prepare, I looked through a few books.  I looked through Jeni Tennison's <em>Beginning XSLT 2.0</em> book, but it wasn't for me.  I didn't like how wordy it was... I got lost in the dialogue, and it distracted me from the points and the examples.  On the otherhand, <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/au/749">Doug Tidwell</a>'s book, <em>XSLT-Mastering XML Tranformations</em> was precisely what I was looking for.  It was concise and organized very methodically.  PLUS, it only cost me $7 with shipping from Amazon.Â  Heh, gotta love that!

[note: because we only use 1.0 on the job, older books were better, as I didn't have to figure out what was a 2.0 feature and what was a 1.0 feature... and again, the books were cheaper]

Fun stuff aside, XSLT is a pretty cool language.Â  I'm too new to it to debate if it is a functional programming language or simply based on those attributes, but I'm happy to get to play with its functional aspects.Â  I am kinda thrilled to dust off my recursive-function-writing skills.Â  I hope to use it early and often, so I can get a good amount of practice in.

The class was useful because it showed me things I didn't pick up from the books.Â  First was the concept that the root node is placed above what I called the XML root node.Â  The class called the XML root node the "document node."Â  Solved one problem that I had been having. The other really enlightening aspect was the axes.Â  When I read the book and saw that there 13, I simply skimmed it.Â  It was good to sit down with , as the following:: and preceding:: axes were not what I thought.

Debbie Lapeyre and Wendell Piez, the instructors, were great and worked with us to answer all of our questions... even my weird set theory questions.Â  Wendell, in particular (because he led the third day) was helpful, showing me some of the common "hacks" people use to make 1.0 do things it wasn't intended to do [despite my incredibly poorly phrased question!].Â  Now that I can understand XPath a little better, I can break down the pieces of the hacks... so things like the Muenchian method actually make sense now.

Hopefully I will get to keep working with XSLT's, I'm definitely not an expert from three days.Â  But since they're core to the portal system I work with, I expect to get a lot more practice in.Â  If I get good enough, I'd love to post some information that may be useful to others.Â  Stay tuned!]]></Content>

		<Title>Not the worst movie ever, and the worst</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[I know the title isn't English... but I'm a little out of it after what I just watched.

Not that I really need to say this, but between writing two blog posts, doing some XSLT exercises, playing with the cat, and a few other random things, I only ended up looking up at Snakes on a Plane about 15 or so times.  I still thought it was terrible, but I think that I saw just the right amount to make it as bearable as possible.

For the record, I think I saw what I consider the worst movie ever the other night.  Went to see Rob Zombie's remake of Halloween, and I was really excited about it.  I really like his music, and thought that he would do a great job with it.  Not even close.  I had so many problems with it that I've tried to block it out of memory.  There was a point near the end where I felt... I felt almost claustrophobic, and wanted to get out.  The only other time that has happened to me was when my parents took me to see <em>Evita</em>... and I found out that musical, and that they would <strong><em>never stop singing</em></strong>.

I would feel wrong if I made a statement like that without supporting it, so let me just point out that you see every single killing full-frame.  No interesting camera angles, and nothing  is left to the imagination.  You simply see a killing machine going about his business without any real interest.  I've seen Itchy and Scratchy episodes with more passion.  But that's all I am going to say... I refuse to keep going, as I won't be able to stop.

Serves me right... everyone knows that Halloween begins and ends with Garfield's Halloween Special (which I am saving for Halloween night itself!)]]></Content>

		<Title>Firefox for Mac and displaying small font sizes</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[So I had a problem a while back where I thought Firefox for Mac was picking up some left-over or un-overridden size styles, while the other browsers were not.  It turns out that it wasn't actually my problem.

While all of the other browsers that I tested... for both Windows and Mac display the default font (serif) set to .8em as glyphs that are 9 pixels tall, Firefox for Mac displays glyphs that are 8 pixels tall, but with 1 pixel of anti-aliasing on top.  The difference of one pixel usually doesn't mean much, but when dealing with font-sizes that small, it makes a big visual difference.

I submitted a Mozilla bug report which has not yet been picked up, but I'm not sure if there's anything to be done, especially if the rendering engine is at all based on the system software (doubtful, since none of the other browsers work the same way).  I wonder if the release of MacOSX Leopard is going to affect this.

Gotta love the Mozilla people, though.  It's such a relief that you can even submit a bug report for something like this.  A chance for actual interaction, and a chance to better the product.  I only wish Microsoft would pay a little attention.]]></Content>

		<Content><![CDATA[Well, that was kinda fun. Â I was trying to create a post, and when after I edited a &lt;pre&gt;, something I did killed WordpressÂ withinÂ Firefox on my MacBook. Â So I went inside and tried it on my frankenmac, and Firefox died there... three times. Â Odd. Â So I turned on my trusty old PC, and it crashed Firefox there too!

Finally,Â IÂ openedÂ OperaÂ forÂ WindowsÂ and it brought up a post with all the categories and title set, but with an empty text box. Â Guess I have to delete that post, and try again! Â Boo!]]></Content>

		<Title>Microformats for you and me</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[After nearly 3 months sitting on my bookshelf, I got around to <img src="http://www.eddiewelker.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/microformats1.png" title="Microformats Logo" alt="Microformats Logo" align="right" border="0" hspace="5" vspace="5" />reading <a href="http://microformats.org/blog/2007/04/19/microformats-the-book/">the Microformats book</a>.  I probably donâ€™t need to mention that theyâ€™ve been pretty high on the â€œbuzzâ€ list for a while now.  That aside, I like the idea, and believe they are worth using.  With this post, I hope to give a high-level overview of Microformatsâ€¦ first sampling what they are and how to use them, followed by my thoughts on why you should use them.

<strong>What and How</strong>

Very simply, Microformats give our already semantic xhtml elements an extra layer of meaning when using a   common set of attribute values.  Consider the case of an â€œ<a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/hcalendar">hCalendar</a>â€, a microformat that gives xhtml the structure of an events calendar.  An events calendar is simply a set of events.  This relationship is easily described by a parent-children relationship.  The problem is that xhtml can easily describe parent-children relationships, yet it cannot semantically describe this calendar-events relationship.  Microformats do just thatâ€¦ they provide a way to describe this common relationship through the use of attribute values.

To create an â€œhCalendarâ€, you would write something like the following:
<blockquote>&lt;div class=â€vcalendarâ€&gt;
<blockquote> &lt;span class=â€veventâ€/&gt;
&lt;div class=â€veventâ€/&gt;
&lt;dl class=â€veventâ€/&gt;</blockquote>
&lt;/div&gt;</blockquote>
As you can see, the supplementary calendar-events structure is added by setting specific attribute values, in this case â€˜vcalendarâ€™ and â€˜veventâ€™.  Microformats use exiting attributes like â€˜classâ€™ and â€˜relâ€™ as hooks for this structure, in the same way these attributes can be used as hooks for additional CSS information.  Additionally, these attributes can be applied to whichever element you choose*.  I demonstrated the use of the same attribute/value pair (class=â€veventâ€) on the â€˜spanâ€™, â€˜divâ€™, and â€˜dlâ€™ elements in the example above.

[* The rules for applying attributes to elements are the same as <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml11/">the existing xhtml spec</a>]

<strong>Why you should use them</strong>

While I foresee a wide array of future uses for Microformats, there are limited practical applications today.  That being said, the small number does not mean they have limited value; their use can provide substantial value.  For example: later this week I am going to re-write the <a href="http://columbiaorchestra.org/season/">concert-listing page</a> for my <a href="http://columbiaorchestra.org"> orchestra website</a>.  I am going to use the hCalendar Microformat to code this seasonâ€™s events.  I will then use an open-source converter to allow users to download a iCal file of this calendar on the fly.

Why would I do this?  Because itâ€™s advantageous. Using the hCalendar Microformat I canâ€¦
<ul>
	<li>provide an additional interface (the iCal file) to my users for free.</li>
	<li>syndicate these events.  That way, if I ping a Microformat aware service (like <a href="http://pingerati.net/">pingerati.net</a>) I will have published these events elsewhere, without any additional work.</li>
	<li>maintain only one source file for multiple outputs (in this case, html, iCal file, and syndicated content)</li>
	<li>use my current knowledge of html as a base for the syntax, requiring me only to learn the Microformats terms and schema before I start using them</li>
</ul>
There are similar uses for the other Microformats, including hCard (contact info), geo and adr (location/address), XFN (relationships between people), and so on.  I invite you to take a look at the <a href="http://microformats.org/blog/2007/04/19/microformats-the-book/">book</a> or the <a href="http://microformats.org/">Microformats website</a> for more information.

I hope thatâ€™s enough to convince you that Microformats are a valid and useful technology.  One of the more compelling aspects is <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/process">the way Microformats are created</a>, yet I think that is interesting enough to warrant itâ€™s own post (look for it later).  Hope someone out there finds this useful.]]></Content>

		<Title>Time for small celebration!</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[Indeed, it is time for a small party... my last 2 to 3 months of work has gone live!

<a href="http://pubmed.gov">http://www.pubmed.gov</a>

Go take a look and see what's wrong with your foot.  :)  Also, make sure to check out my favorite PubMed article.  I'll give you the id... just search for that.  It's: 17328369.

Unfortunately, it isn't a complete overhaul... in fact, it's pretty minor.   There are many things that I would like to improve that were "put-away" for later.  The good thing is that it is a really big step, and based on today's meeting, it certainly isn't the last.  I am excited about the things I can do to the next major release... if that is what I end up working on next.]]></Content>

		<Title>Long 3 day weekend</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[So I return from East Hampton.Â  800 miles to empty out the freezer (and then de-ice it with only a metal spatula).Â Â  Alright, so I've had some better trips.Â  At least the <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/ed_welker/499972493/">Amagansett Farmer's Market</a> was good.Â  And the surf looked good (if not near-frozen). I won't go into details, but my weekend consisted of:
<ul>
	<li>800 Miles of driving.Â  That's a lot.Â  Additionally, I got stuck in one traffic jam on the L.I.E., but made my orchestra rehearsal... by three minutes.</li>
	<li>Cleaning out the fridge, bringing in the latter, insulating the skylight, closing windows, bringing in tools, and all of the other things we do to "close down" the house.Â  Not sure why I did it all myself.</li>
	<li>Cutting the large fallen branch of a red-pine tree.Â  It was so large that I had to cut it with my small handsaw... so I could simply drag it across the yard.</li>
	<li>Finding out my favorite pizza place of the last 20 years is now owned by someone else.Â  Instead of Yankees photos on the wall (even I can admit it's appropriate for a NY pizza joint), the woman who ran my credit card was wearing a VA Tech sweatshirt.Â  That's simply wrong.Â  Boo, Springs Pizza, boo.</li>
	<li>I gave the chinese place a second chance... turned out to be the worst chinese I've ever had.Â  Heh, and the place was called "Best Taste," of all things.</li>
</ul>
Now that I am back, my list of tasks continues.Â  Bills are due soon, room looks like a tornado hit it, still trying to rent the basement, want to get Xmas shopping done early.Â  Groan.

I promise to edit the photos soon too... I've got about 5,000 on backlog.Â  Groan-again.]]></Content>

I've posted the first two to my newly purchased flickr pro account (I ran over the 200 image limit, and want to continue to see the old ones.)<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/ed_welker/sets/72157603191451734/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2124/2034253840_d914f88ea1_m.jpg" title="ashes of kings" alt="ashes of kings" align="right" border="0" height="240" hspace="8" vspace="8" width="180" /></a>

		<Title>Review of High Performance Web Sites</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[When I came across <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/9780596529307/"><img src="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/covers/9780596529307_cat.gif" title="High Performance Web Sites Cover" alt="High Performance Web Sites Cover" align="right" border="0" height="236" hspace="8" vspace="8" width="180" /></a><a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/9780596529307/">High Performance Web Sites; Essential Knowledge for Frontend Engineers</a> on Amazon, I was excited.  I've been actively using the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yslow/">Yslow plugin</a> for <a href="http://www.getfirebug.com/">Firebug</a>, and was interested in finding out more.   At the day job I can't implement each of the 14 rules myself, however the plugin is useful none-the-less.  It's terrific to have a checklist to work off of when entering QA mode, that way you're sure not to forget anything.

For those who are not familiar with Yslow, it is (again) a plugin for the firebug, the addon for <a href="http://www.mozilla.com">Firefox</a>.  It tests a website based on <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html">14 varying rules</a>, from server settings to page construction.  There are a few on the list that most people haven't heard of, yet are rather important (I had never heard of an ETag much less known what to do with one).   When Yslow came out, I took a peek at <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html">the best practices document</a> which briefly explained each of the rules.  I wanted to find out more, so I ordered the book.  Unfortunately, High Performance Web Sites let me down for just that reason.  I didn't find out much more.

High Performance Web Sites starts off with a table listing <a href="http://alexa.com/">alexa</a>'s top 10 U.S. websites (substituting AOL.com for craigslist.org).   Then, 14 chapters (one for each rule) are devoted to explaining the rule, and showing how many of the top 10 are implementing it.  The final chapter steps through the 10 websites and shows what they do to reduce the load time of their websites.

My problem was that the book really didn't offer any new information.  Basically, the best practices document was explained in slightly greater depth...but only slightly.  I was disappointed to find out that there were very few additional ideas in the book... apparently the 14 rules cover the possibilities of writing faster-loading websites (ahem).  The chapter analyzing the ten major websites had a ton of room for furthering ideas, but offered a limited few.

I was most disappointed in the book because I had looked forward to more.  The plugin itself, and the list of rules are both terrific.  Having a concise set of tests to walk through is extremely valuable.  I can not say the same for the book.  I hope my money went towards further work, yet I wonder how that's being filtered through O'Reilly (the publisher) and Yahoo (the official creator of Yslow).   I recommend reading <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html">the Yslow best practices</a>, and taking a look at <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yslow/help/">the Yslow user guide</a> instead.]]></Content>

		<Title>Another design tweak</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[As you might have noticed, I've been a bit pre-occupied recently.  And likely will be so in the future.  So a design for this site has once again been placed on the back burner.  I am good for a tweak-ing, however.

Looks fine in Firefox 2 for mac/pc.  Opera, has a small problem, I think due to a varied em interpretation (it's different on each platform). I tried IE6, and of course, things were missing, but the design as a whole stood up.  So a few "non-lazy" changes should do the trick.  Having only spent 30 minutes and using :before and :after pseudo attributes, I was surprised IE didn't send my PC up in flames.

It just occurs to me, it would be nice if I could add a little javascript (for fun, not practical usage).  Not sure what I would add it to, however.  Oh well, placed on my to-do list after the real design.]]></Content>

		<Title>Random Thoughts</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[1) <a href="http://ejohn.org/blog/beautiful-programming-books/">The idea of beautiful programming books representing the connection between art and programming</a> is an interesting one.  I think that there is an "art" to programming, but I don't think there is really a direct connection.  As a musician, I have a very formal vision of an "artist", and knowing many programmers, few have qualities that I consider artistic.  I think that the art of programming is different than visual or music arts.  That being said, there are many artistic looking books, including programming books.  My favorite is <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/BTLS/">The Little Schemer</a>, and it's successful typography. <a href="http://gothamist.com/2007/12/29/wga_update_real.php" id="file-link-59" title="David Letterman"></a>

<a href="http://edwardwelker.com/wordpress/wp-admin/upload.php?style=inline&amp;tab=browse&amp;action=view&amp;ID=59&amp;post_id=-1198988865" id="file-link-59" title="David Letterman" class="file-link image"> 			 </a> 2) I'm glad to hear that <a href="http://gothamist.com/2007/12/29/wga_update_real.php">David Letterman and his group pulled off a deal with the Writers Guild</a>.  Not only do I like his humor more than others, but he impresses me as a substantial human being.  Way to go Dave... the beard, however, is kinda weird.

3) <a href="http://edwardwelker.com/2007/12/28/cats-out-of-the-bag/">My friends are onto the fact that I have a blog</a>.  They really don't need any more ammunition for calling me a nerd.  Be that as it may, I am going to try to be more social, in the wake of my father's passing.

4) One of the books that was recommended as "beautiful" in #1 was <a href="http://processing.org/">a book on Processing</a>.  I have been putting off looking into it (so I can relearn my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Introductory-Graph-Theory-Gary-Chartrand/dp/0486247759">Graph Theory</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Learning-Python-3rd-Mark-Lutz/dp/0596513984/">learn Python</a> for the first time, among other things).  But when I found that it included techniques for data visualization, I added it near the top of my to-do list.  If only I can find enough free time to finish with Graph Theory or Python!

5) The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/30/sports/football/30patriots.html">Giants looked better against the Patriots</a> than I had expected.  Their downfall was similar to that of the Ravens and Eagles; not being aggressive enough in the second half of the game.  I'm not sure what teams do during halftime, but they came out flat, and tight.  It would be nice, however, if they could use this game as a springboard for their playoff game next week.

6) I hadn't realized that there was a book created to be a sequel to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Elements-Style-Fourth-William-Strunk/dp/0205313426/">Strunk &amp; White</a>.  I've had <a href="http://bobulate.com/2007/12/27/full-of-class-an-interview-with-joseph-williams/">Style: Ten Lessons in Clarity and Grace</a> on my wishlist for a while, but it just shot up near the top.  <a href="http://bobulate.com/">Liz, the interviewer</a>, has written a few posts that have turned me on to a number of Information Architecture books.  And now this.  I know she plays the cello... I think her brain works A-D-G-C just like mine.

7)  I've been hard at work designing a new version of <a href="http://pubmed.gov">My NCBI</a>, while thinking in terms of designing a base application class for all NCBI applications (using the new system inheritance feature).  I haven't had to deal with large-scale OOP for a while, and feel a bit rusty.  I'm thrilled to be working through the rust. That, and <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/nih_law_29b_in_health_science.php">the new spending bill</a> should make sure that I am working on this for a long time.  Exiting times.

And #8:Â  January 1: My birthday.]]></Content>

		<Title>Back on two wheels</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[I rode my bike to work today.  It was the first time I had done that in an excruciatingly long time.<a href="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1249/532591704_41e00e0652_b.jpg" title="LeMond fixie"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1249/532591704_41e00e0652_m.jpg" title="LeMond" alt="LeMond" align="left" border="0" height="180" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="240" /></a>  Everything in the world came up between.  The weather over the last few days, however, has been so nice that I couldn't resist any longer.  So last night I put a new tube in the front wheel, and took the Lemond bike that wouldn't kill me (39 x 17 lower fixed-gear ratio, shown to the left) rather than the one (my fav. Bianchi, 42 x 15) that was ready-to-go, but may have killed me.

It turns out that neither would have killed me.  I made it up the rather stiff hill in front of NIH quite easily.  Didn't get to work gasping for air, feeling sore legs, anything.  Really quite boring, come to think of it.   But it was a great day to be outside.  It's too bad that the trip is so short as it wasn't quite the work that I would like, but I can only take what's given to me.   The next day I have more time, I am going to venture around downtown Bethesda.  Seems like a fairly bike-friendly town.  I don't really make New Year's Resolutions, as they're more birthday resolutions to me, but I am definitely going to ride more this year.   Last year was a long string of mistakes.  Beach road, here I come.

Not that I want to jinx this beautiful weather, but I have gloves, my head warmer and all the rest lined up for when it returns to normal January weather.]]></Content>

		<Title>Update to some random thoughts</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[1) I took a look at the book on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processing_(programming_language)">Processing</a>, and it does look quite nice.Â  That being said, I'm not quite sure what I'd use it for.Â  So it fell a bit on my list.

2) Letterman is still pretty much the same.Â  I haven't seen Leno.Â  Jon Stewart, however, looked TOTALLY crazy last night.Â  It was really quite scary.

3) Rob Coburn, you had better hang out with Raluca and I pretty darned soon....

4) Despite ordering the Python in a Nutshell book, I have semi-officially decided to put off learning Python for a bit.Â  I think that I am going to re-focus my attentions on Scheme, and work my way through the Little Schemer, <a href="http://www.scheme.com/tspl3/">The Scheme Programming Language</a>, and <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/">SICP</a>. Â  I've been through some of them, but haven't gotten to the end of any of them.

5) The Giants won! Beat the Bucs, and are going to play the Cowboys next week.Â  I hate the Cowboys, so this is going to be a big deal.Â  I'll probably try to watch it.

6) <a href="http://stevedockery.com">Steve</a>, congrats on the potential new-old gig!]]></Content>

		<Title><![CDATA[what I&#8217;ve been up to]]></Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[Though I doubt it will mean anything to anyone... I threw this diagram together Monday night.  It's <a href="http://edwardwelker.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/myncbiwireframesv1.pdf" title="NCBI Application design"></a><a href="http://www.eddiewelker.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/ncbibaseapp_designv1.pdf" title="my application design">my application design</a> for a default NCBI application. I'm pretty excited about it. Not too fancy, but a nice start.

I've also been thinking about writing a Firefox extension.  It's about time that I play around with it, and I was thinking that a pretty simple app (like <a href="http://www.twitbin.com/">twitbin</a>) would be a good place to start.  No plans yet, but... ideas.

Speaking of ideas, when is <a href="http://twitter.com">twitter</a> going to become open source and (then) de-centralized?  That would be awesome...

Alright, now time to take the design and make it generic... woo hoo overloading!]]></Content>

		<Title>Twitter inspires similar thoughts (when broken!)</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[First, I just watched what can only be described as a "herd" of squirrels, run across a neighbors front lawn.  I've seen one chase another before, but I have never seen 5 all move together with a direction change.  Very odd.  Anyway...

A few days ago, I questioned in passing, when <a href="http://twitter.com" title="twitter.com">Twitter</a> would start operating as a decentralized service.  I asked because it was down at the time (outages are annoying, and I was bored). Apparently it was due to the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/01/15/twitter-fails-macworld-keynote-test/">MacWorld keynote address</a>... so basically, Apple did it. Who cares, I was still bored.  My friends were probably doing something amazing...

My two-second solution to the outages (and my current boredom) was decentralization of Twitter.  And apparently, I <a href="http://dembot.com/post/23874410">was not</a> <a href="http://www.scripting.com/stories/2008/01/16/aDecentralizedTwitter.html">the only</a> <a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/blog/decentralized-twitter-thoughts">one</a>.  Some questioned twitter's usefulness as an emergency alert system.   (My gut tells me that system wouldn't work.  In an emergency, most will grab their phones, not run to post a tweet.  Also, there's <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/?p=7614">no way I'm paying $20 for "industrial twitter." </a> Anyway, I digress...)

There were also a few implementation ideas tossed around. I would implement based on a bittorrent model.  You want your friends updates (call him friend B).  You both have friend A in common, and friend A has friend B's updates.  There are now two places to obtain friend B's updates. Voila.   What about storage... what happens when you don't want to hold all of my 1700 updates? Well, that's where a few redundant twitter history servers pick up the slack, and algorithms figuring out when they start picking that slack.

[there are those squirrels again!]

Protected permissions would have to be dealt with, so give the client instructions to handle them.   And I do mean client.  Extend <a href="http://iconfactory.com/software/twitterrific">twitterific</a> or a similar program, they would be fine for such a task [though I may leave phone-based clients out].  Why use a client instead of a dedicated server? One of twitter's biggest draws is ease of use.   Lets keep it that way... installing a server app is annoying to some, impossible to others.

I may have overlooked some flaws, but the basic model seems alright to me. A social network like this seems tailor-made for a distributed model.

So those are my two cents.  Which I'm only spending so that I'm not bored when twitter is down.]]></Content>

		<Title>Finally, I get feedburner</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[So I have off for Martin Luther King day today.Â  I found myself with a chunk of time, and decided once and for all, to make <a href="http://feedburner.com">feedburner</a> work for me.Â  Happily, I can now say that I did that, and can move on.

You will notice the bright orange RSS logo on the side there... that now squishes my blog, del.icio.us links, and flickr images together for a nice big mess.Â  Just the way I like it.

Feedburner is not hard, but I had no patience for it.Â  I was under the assumption that you added your feeds, and there would be a grand final step where you could parse them all together.Â  I kept looking around for this final step, but it turns out this is not the case.Â  Instead, you choose one of your feeds, and then add little "enhancements" to pull in specific alternate feeds, such as del.icio.us, and flickr.Â  Lame, compared to what I was thinking, but much faster than writing my own parser.

Of course, I'm sure everyone else out there understood this, so I'm being redundant.Â  Oh well.Â  That's what you get when you try to learn everything from scratch.]]></Content>

		<Title>IE8, Doctype and potentially broken default behavior</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[I woke up this morning and read the A List Apart articles (that I defered reading until this a.m.). Â The powers that be have decided that <a HREF="http://alistapart.com/articles/beyonddoctype">IE will now use a metatag to decide what rendering type</a>Â (ie6,Â ie7,Â ie9, etc.) to use. Â This allows for backwards compatibility. Â Supposedly.

First,Â IÂ don'tÂ reallyÂ careÂ aboutÂ theÂ meta.Â Â It'sÂ fine...Â itÂ isÂ just one more trick to add to the pile. Generally, I agree with <a HREF="http://alistapart.com/articles/fromswitchestotargets">Eric Meyer's points</a>, that it'sÂ betterÂ thanÂ browserÂ switching.Â Â AndÂ itÂ is.Â Â It's also better than conditional CSS comments.

There are a few problems that I see, however.  The first one was actually thrown into my lap as a twitter discussion between <a HREF="http://adactio.com/">Jeremy Keith</a> (down-to-earth web guy) and <a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/cwilso/">Chris Wilson</a> (worksÂ onÂ IE). Following the twitter-timeline, <a HREF="http://twitter.com/adactio/statuses/627930532">first</a>, <a HREF="http://twitter.com/cwilso/statuses/628255922">second</a>, <a HREF="http://twitter.com/adactio/statuses/628305212">third</a>. Apparently the default behavior for rendering a document with a HTML 4.01 doctype will be IE7.  That's right, it doesn't fall through, it will be stuck on IE7.  That is just wrong.  Hopefully, bothÂ JeremyÂ andÂ Chris and the other powers that be work that detail out further before Microsoft proceeds.

My second worry is the case of "edge."  Edge, as far as I am concerned, stands for &lt;i&gt;bleeding edge&lt;/i&gt;, and that implies an experimental version, where results will be unpredictable.Â Â (IÂ inferÂ thatÂ definitionÂ basedÂ onÂ everyÂ otherÂ softwareÂ releaseÂ thatÂ I've heard of.)  Hopefully that's not the case, but there sure as heck better be a concrete definition of what they consider "edge". Â Hopefully they'll throw a "current major version" in there as well. Â Who knows.

The third, and probably largest concern that I have, is that we are now relying on Microsoft to include past browser rendering attributes into current browsers.  So IE8 should be able to render all of IE7's quirks, as well as IE6's quirks. Based on the fact that Microsoft had a hard time fully flushing out all of the CSS standards for so long, whats to say that that they'll accomplish this in full. Additionally, there are the worries that including past rendering attribues will yeild the "bloatware" that Eric mentioned.

And finally (at least for today) there's the mess of doctype and meta. Â Now you get to define things in both places. Â It's just sortof kludgy. Â One more thing that I have to memorize, and I hate memorizing things.

Anyway, it's Day one of this stuff, and there will be much discussion to come, and I'm guessing a lot of other stuff as well.]]></Content>

		<Title>The IE8 doctype meta waiting game</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[The first time I played Yahtzee was... only about a month ago. I won 3 of my first 4 games.  It was a fun game.  I wonder how that game would be if I played against... oh, let's say... Microsoft.  Probably... not so much.

<a href="http://adactio.com/">Jeremy Keith</a>, my favorite famous-web-developer-that-I-watch-from-afar-via-his-blog (sorry, didn't have a better term for that... he seems like a fun guy) has <a href="http://adactio.com/journal/1403">written a follow up post about the IE8 doctype meta mess</a>.  As I've come to expect, he has eloquently suggested a rational and positive approach to the proposal.  As I mentioned <a href="http://edwardwelker.com/2008/01/22/ie8-doctype-and-potentially-broken-default-behavior/">in my last post</a>, the meta isn't really that terrible, while the default behavior <em><strong>is</strong></em>.  Jeremy, along with others, suggest we need to politely and intelligently urge Microsoft, hoping they re-consider.  This of course, is the correct course of action.  Insults, and things of that nature are just a waste... life's too short.

The problem, is that life is short. The list of things that we're waiting on from Microsoft is long.  And there is very little crossed off! We're still waiting on correct handling of CSS.  We're still waiting on correct javascript behavior.  I worry that it will be forever before Microsoft takes it's turn in this game.

I'm all for civil discourse.  This IE8 hub-bub made me instantly think of an online petition.  But while I will be cheering Microsoft on, excuse me if I keep my fingers crossed behind my back.  Will Microsoft make the next move? Will they pause the game and get back to it?  Hopefully.  My father always told me that we had a relative who would pretend to sneeze while kicking the checker board.  That wouldn't be nice, but it would be swift.  A game ended by neglect may be far more painful.]]></Content>

		<Title>Writing Scheme in Javascript I</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[This is an interesting little function that I ran across in Kent Dybvig's <em><a href="http://www.scheme.com/tspl3/start.html#./start:h9">The Scheme Programming Language</a>.</em>  I thought I would give it a go in javascript.  I wrote it out, and ran into two problems.  First, I wasn't returning anything from the anonymous-self-executing function, so it was being garbage collected, and the call to tell() would give an undefined (secret didn't exist anymore).  The second was that I initially declared secret without the <em>var</em> which gave it global scope.  Took me a little while to figure these out, but since I haven't looked at any javascript in months, I don't feel so bad.
<code><pre>

/* the original function from The Scheme Programming Language
(define shhh #f)
(define tell #f)

(let ((secret 0))
  (set! shhh
    (lambda (message)
      (set! secret message)))
  (set! tell
    (lambda ()
      secret)))</code></pre>
<pre><code>
(shhh "sally likes harry")
(tell) <graphic> "sally likes harry"
secret <graphic> Error: variable secret is not bound
*/
</graphic></graphic></code></pre>
<pre><code><graphic><graphic>//the Javascript version of the same function
</graphic></graphic></code></pre>
<pre><code><graphic><graphic>var shhh = false;
var tell = (function(){
 var secret = 0;
 shhh = function(message) { secret = message; }
 return function() { console.info(secret); }
})();

shhh("harry likes sally");
console.info("tell: " + tell() );</graphic></graphic></pre></code>]]></Content>

		<Title>Random February Thoughts</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[In an effort to inspire me to write something else, I am throwing a few thoughts out from the last month.

My orchestra, <a href="http://columbiaorchestra.org">The Columbia Orchestra</a>, is playing Beethoven's Ninth Symphony for our next concert. The orchestra is trying to make at least a small cultural event out of it.  There is a website (embracingthemillions.com) a flickr discussion group (<a href="http://flickr.com/groups/embracingthemillions">flickr.com/groups/embracingthemillions</a>), and a number of artists (not just musicians) participating in the event.  Since I threw together the website (no comments please, I've been very busy), I know the statistics of people visiting it.  And there are quite a few people visiting.Â  What I can't figure out is with 30 or so people visiting per-day, why hasn't anyone a) commented, b) written something on the discussion board?  I made a post in the discussion group.Â  It took me a few minutes at best.Â  No one else has posted.Â   Are people's lives really so busy that they can't be bothered?  I'm confused by this.Â  Technology aside, I am delighted to be playing Beethoven, he was simply a genius.

I went to see the Ingmar Bergman film, <em>The Magician</em> the other day at the <a href="http://afi.com/silver">AFI Silver Theater</a>.  I liked the quirky nature of the film, and found it to be totally engaging (I've yet to see one of his films that isn't).  I regret not being able to see more movies from the <a href="http://www.afi.com/silver/new/nowplaying/2008/v5i1/bergman.aspx">first part of the Bergman Retrospective</a> they are doing now, as I have been ridiculously busy of late.  However, I do own most of them on DVD (I don't own the Magician).  I look forward to the next few parts of this retrospective, as I don't know as many of his later works.

I have been working extremely hard on the next version of My NCBI, the preferences section of the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">NCBI website</a>.  This is where you can set preferences for PubMed, Blast, and all of the rest of the NCBI sites/databases.  It is hard, writing everything in a internally-created language, which is slightly buggy and tends to make easy things easy, but hard things very hard, with XSLTs completing the system.  I haven't had to write a ton of recursive XSLT functions or anything, (mostly because of the inclusion of <a href="http://www.exslt.org/">EXSLT extensions</a>), but development time is still very slow.  It also seems that with every step I take forward, I discover 4 new things I have to do.  Throw in the fact I made time estimates without knowing the language, and the NCBI announcement that the budget fell flat (and actually decreased) this year and people were dismissed, and that makes my life particularly fun. I knew what I was getting into when I signed up, and I wanted to do a LOT of work, but that doesn't mean I feel that way every second of every day.

Additionally, I've had to meet a bunch of deadlines for the legal aspects of my dad's passing.  Trips/talks to lawyers, a visit to DC Vital Records, Orphan's Court (yes, they call it that!) and NASA have really been a... treat, let's say.

Also, some of the better (or at least unexpected) and smaller moments of the month were:
<ul>
	<li>Re-discovering IRC.  I hadn't even thought of IRC until I saw it mentioned in a twitter post.  I found, however, that the groups in irc.freenode.net are going strong.  I've read some of the #scheme discussion, answered a considerable number of questions in the #html and #css groups, and just lurked watching #microformats and #javascript.  Interesting stuff.</li>
	<li>I've been taking <a href="http://flickr.com/people/ed_welker">a number of photos</a>.  I like holding on to moments, which is probably why I like taking pictures so much.  Hopefully I will continue.  I keep telling myself that if I do, I'll upgrade to a D-SLR when I finally get all of my money issues (paying my father's bills) worked out.</li>
	<li>I went on a kick of listening to nothing but David Bowie (thanks <a href="http://twitter.com/ashleylynn">@ashleylynn</a>) which was nice. I've been floundering around, listening to whatever CD was closest for a while now.  I love finally regaining some direction.  I also feel a Prokofiev kick coming on.  Maybe, maybe not.</li>
	<li>I got a new monitor. A Dell 24" flatscreen, which I really like.  I knew they were coming out with new models (which have since arrived on their website), and luckily the only real difference was HDMI inputs, which I don't need since I don't plan on watching HD movies or TV on it (unless from my computer).  My PC now has the 24" as the main, and my 20" rotated 90 deg. as a secondary.  It is an extremely useful setup.  I love the multiple inputs, since the press of a button on the front will switch me from PC to Mac and back again</li>
	<li>The Giants won the Superbowl.  That was teriffic.  So my Red Sox took the World Series, my Giants have the Superbowl, who will win the NBA Championship?  (Ha, not the Knicks!) But I would love to see Detroit or Boston make the finals.  Especially Detroit, I think.</li>
	<li>I ordered a new laptop hard-drive from <a href="http://newegg.com">Newegg</a>, which should arrive either today or Monday. I installed Leopard on it last month, and during that time got tired of squeezing everything onto my tiny 60gb drive.  So 250gb will be here soon, and I'll transfer.  I've found the only thing I really like about Leopard is Spaces, the virtual window manager.  On the otherhand, it works in ways I don't expect (or think it should work).  Eventually, I will look to see if there are some command line settings I can use to change behavior.  For now, it will just occasionally annoy me.</li>
</ul>
Finally, I am quite tired of the weather.  Continual cold with occasional teases of warmer temperatures have made this, in my mind, one of the longest winters ever.  I can't wait for even slightly warmer temperatures, so I can convince myself to get back outside on my bike.  I haven't rode, again, in forever.  I look forward to changing that.]]></Content>

		<Title>Big release day on the webbernet</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[So I guess it's simply the time of year.  Many big releases today... software, APIs, and more!

First, the biggest.  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/ie/ie8/readiness/default.htm" title="Microsoft releases Internet Explorer 8 Beta">IE8 has been released</a> in initial beta.  The release was also included a general overview of IE8's new features and fixes.  It's actually quite a lot of information to absorb all at once.  I've skimmed a number of <a href="http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/ie8whitepapers" title="Whitepapers for Microsoft Internet Explorer 8">the IE8 whitepapers</a>, and feel the biggest changes are W3C's <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/" title="Web Accessibility Initiative-Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WIA-ARIA</a> support, <a href="http://" title="Acid 2">Acid2</a> compliance, the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkID=110273" title="selectors api">javascript selectors api</a>, and their assertion of achieving <a href="http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/Project/Download/FileDownload.aspx?ProjectName=ie8whitepapers&amp;DownloadId=1025" title="css 2.1 compliance">CSS 2.1 compliance</a>.  Of course, the devil is in the details, and there is no company for which that statement is more true.  They have a lot of work ahead, and we know they talk a good game.  The big upside, however, is that they are actually talking about it.  Out in the open.  Big step, and I applaud them for that.

The other biggest buzz of the day was from Yahoo, in announcing the <a href="http://fireeagle.yahoo.net/" title="Yahoo Fire Eagle Website">beta of their Fire Eagle service</a>, an API for broadcasting your physical location to the web.  I wouldn't call it earth-shattering, but I think that there's a good chance a number of cool things are built with it.  <a href="http://developer.yahoo.net/blogs/theater/archives/2008/03/fire_eagle_launches.html" title="Yahoo's Fire Eagle API introduced">Watch the video of it's introduction</a>, and then <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2008/03/05/yahoo-launches-fire-eagle/" title="Yahoo Fire Eagle Quick Overview">take a look here</a> to quickly get an idea of the details.  It would appear from the details that it was written in a highly usable way.

Of more direct importance to me, <a href="http://googledataapis.blogspot.com/2008/03/3-2-1-contact-api-has-landed.html" title="Google introduces Contacts API for accessing Gmail contacts securely">Google has announced their Contacts API</a>. I despise when sites ask me to enter my username/password for <em>other sites</em>.  The most offensive request is for Gmail.  I don't have any interesting emails, let me tell you... but I certainly don't want to let others read them.  The Contacts API is a safe way for distribution and use of your Gmail contacts, without threatening the security of your Gmail account or your other Google-stored information.  With this, I should be able to sync my Gmail contacts with my desktop mail contacts.  I'm very happy about that.

Heading up the long-since-overdue category, <a href="http://dev.aol.com/aim" title="AOL opens Instant Messenger Protocol, OpenAIM">AOL has announced they've opened their Instant Messenger Protocol, OpenAIM</a>.  <strong>Finally</strong>.  I remember ages ago when... well, it's all in the past now.  That's one big wall that has been broken down between protocols, and hopefully Yahoo and Microsoft will fall in line.  It will be great if other apps can finally use the features that have been limited to the AIM client for all this time.  I use <a href="http://www.adiumx.com/" title="Adium; A Mac Instant Messenging Client">Adium</a> and <a href="http://www.pidgin.im/" title="Pidgin; Open Source Messenging Client">Pidgin</a> most of the time (Adium, I believe uses Pidgin's core), and look forward to seeing what they do with the new open protocol.   (On a personal note, hopefully this doesn't spell any negative news for my friends who work on AIM.)

And to round things off, here's two smaller releases today (one based on IE8's Activities):
<ul>
	<li>The <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4106" title="Operator Plugin for Mozilla Firefox">Firefox Operator plugin</a> (for <a href="http://www.microformats.org" title="Microformats website">Microformats</a>) has already <a href="http://www.kaply.com/weblog/2008/03/05/microsoft-activities-for-firefox/" title="Operator Plugin initial release implementing Activities">given a go at implementing Activities</a>, which were announced at today's IE8 overview.</li>
	<li><a href="http://open.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/03/05/the-new-york-times-perl-profiler/" title="New York Times contributes profiling perl module to CPAN">The New York Times has contributed a perl module to CPAN</a>.  Looks like a useful profiling tool, especially since it profiles line-by-line.</li>

		<Title>Using the label element for form accessibility</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[I've always been a fan of the &lt;label&gt; element.  It's an incredibly simple way to make a form more accessible.  It does two things:
<ul>
	<li>It explicitly associates text with a form element, so a screenreader doesn't have to guess what text goes with what form element.</li>
	<li>For checkboxes/radio buttons, it gives the user a larger click area, which is useful for people with limited vision (or me, since I always end up missing them!)</li>
</ul>
You can find a number of simple usage examples on the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/H44.html"><acronym title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</acronym>'s <acronym title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</acronym> Techniques page for labels</a>.

I recently discovered something new about the &lt;label&gt; element (new to me).  I hadn't realized that you can associate <strong>multiple labels</strong> to one form element.  This is useful because it allows you to associate even more information with a form element.  With it, I could write something like this:
<pre><code>&lt;label for="box"&gt;1. &lt;/label&gt;

&lt;input type="checkbox" id="box"/&gt;

&lt;label for="box"&gt;This is some text with a </code></pre>
<pre><code>&lt;abbr title="full title name"&gt;shrt. title&lt;/abbr&gt; other stuff inside.&lt;/label&gt;</code></pre>
This isn't the most useful example, but I think it demonstrates the general idea.  [Note: normally, I wouldn't write out an explicit number, I would use an unordered list.  But without major support for <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/generate.html#counters" title="CSS Counters">CSS counters</a>, I find myself between a rock and a hard place.]   My optimism was quickly quashed though, because, as <a href="http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200711/use_the_label_element_to_make_your_html_forms_accessible/">Roger Johansson mentions, screenreaders tend to ignore two labels</a>.   I will have to do some of my own testing to find out more, but I find this very disappointing.

Another interesting application is to include labels for screenreaders, while using CSS to hide them from visual users. Just make your label a block element, give it a 0 width (to remove the width it would have taken in the document flow), and move it off-screen.  You cannot simply <code>display: none</code> the label, as that usually hides it from screenreaders.  I would like to look further into the end result using current technology (<a href="http://juicystudio.com/article/invisible-form-prompts.php">hoping for improved results since 2004</a>), but I certainly believe this leaves <strong>no excuse</strong> for anyone NOT including labels in their forms.

Back to using one label again, I ran into a <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=163912">Firefox Bug where a link is included in a label element</a>.  When a link is clicked inside a label element that is associated with a checkbox, the checkbox becomes checked!  Hit the back button, and the item will still be checked, with the visual check the only evidence anything happened.  You can see how this would not be friendly to a screenreader (not to mention visual users!)   IE and Opera both behave without checking the box.  If you have a moment, <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=163912"><em>please vote for this bug</em></a> and help me get it fixed.

P.S. - when I mention "hoping" to test further, I mean when my Jaws activation FINALLY gets worked out.]]></Content>

I've decided that once I do that, I will retire my Olympus C-8080, and move on to a Digital SLR.  Reviews are mixed (at best) about the E-3, and I may like something better than the E-510.  Anyway, I'm getting ahead of myself... use the camera I have first!]]></Content>

		<Title>itâ€™s about time</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[I have no time for anything!

This is how I usually feel.  There are so many things in the world that I want to do/know about, and yet they all take time to do/learn.  I don't have any big to-dos that eat large chunks of my time either... I work, I have my orchestra, I eat, and I relax.  I try to use relaxation time for learning/discovery (when I can, of course).  It is just very hard.  I haven't taken an analytical approach to the problem yet, but I think I should sometime soon (of course, that may take a while to get to.)

I don't often rely on calendars, I may have to start.  I don't feel like people 'rob' me of time, but I think I should pay attention to that.  And of course, I am always trying to make my learning/doing time more efficient (that's the only thing I have down pat).

Ok, enough rant.  Now just a little tip-of-the-hat to what I've missed recently...  the <a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/452984/">FringeDC Meeting</a>, the <a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/460659/">Refresh DC Happy Hour</a>, the first <a href="http://www.refreshbmore.org/">Refresh Baltimore Meeting</a> AND <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/refresh-baltimore-planning">planning group</a>, as well as my books, especially the Web Navigation, RESTful Services, Graph Theory, and Discrete Math books!Â  (This is not to mention the projects I'd like to get started!)

Maybe I'll just win the lottery.  That may buy me some more time.]]></Content>

		<Title>PHP and Me</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[I just finished writing a not-so-simple, not-so-complex PHP script.Â  First, lemme say that I had a good time with it, since it isn't either XSLT or Portal (my workplace's homebrew) code.Â  It's kinda refreshing to look outside of my multi-month project.Â  Exciting, in fact... despite how insignificant (in the grand scheme of things) it is.

I've got to admit, thought, that I don't really like PHP.Â  I'm not going to bash PHP outright (as I've heard MANY people do).Â  It is a programming language, and it certainly has it's place.Â  I've used many things written in PHP. Â  In fact, I feel bad about the way people dismiss PHP.Â  That said, I still don't like it.Â Â  My problem is that I feel PHP is simply too verbose.Â  There seems to be a function for everything.Â  It is the total opposite of Scheme, where every function is a based on a handful of core functions.Â  I have had to deal with a number of languages in my life, and I certainly prefer languages with as little syntax as possible.

I spend a lot of time googling the functions.Â  And then the parameters.Â  And then the return types.Â  And then I run across another function that is kinda like the first one that I saw, but slightly different (maybe even described as more or less efficient!)Â  And then I have to research the return types.Â Â  I'm mostly bothered by the related functions.Â  Just give me something I can use in different ways.Â  Don't give me the kitchen sink and tell me to choose the faucet type.

This is the same problem that I have with XSLTs.Â  It is a rather verbose language (which happens to usually be interspersed in XML/HTML).Â  This makes it hard to pick-up in a hurry, and makes it unintuitive.Â  This is important.Â  Unintuitive.Â  I spend a major part of my work day making sure that all of the webpages, all of the components, all of the behavior... even the URLs of my work are intuitive.Â  So I don't like to accept much less from the tools I work with.

To extend the analogy slightly further... I have seen that when websites are unintuitive, that said websites can fail.Â  Is the same thing the case for programming languages?]]></Content>

		<Title>My first flickr video</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[<p>I'm pretty happy with Flickr's new video service... I took this video back at the beginning of Feb, and tried to upload it to YouTube, where it was promptly rejected for being in the wrong format.  I didn't want to bother converting it, so I just forgot about it for a while.  Flickr, on the otherhand, instantly uploaded and converted the file for me.  All I had to do was pick the file.  Since I've been ridiculously busy, I can't beat the convenience factor with a stick!  So enjoy!</p>

		<Title><![CDATA[Getting a button element&#8217;s value attribute (not innerHTML) in IE]]></Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[After spending a small part of my evening debugging Javascript in IE (which is ALWAYS a pleasure), I found out one of my errors was a mistake I had made before... trying to access button.value in IE.Â  IE, of course, being IE, returns the innerHTML value of the button, instead of the value attribute.Â  Last time I ran into this, I used a class instead of value, and moved on with my life.Â  Tonight, I was feeling stubborn, and I found a better way...

target.value = target.getAttributeNode('value').nodeValue;

I'm sure I'm about the millionth person to discover this, but I couldn't find it anywhere using standard searches, so I thought I'd try to emphasize it here so others could find it. (Hopefully it's not so common that <em>everyone else</em> knows it!)

At first, I used the following:

target.value =Â  target.attributes.getNamedItem('value').nodeValue;

Then I looked at <a href="http://www.davidflanagan.com/">Flanagan's</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596101996?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=davidflanagancom&amp;link_code=as3&amp;camp=211189&amp;creative=373489&amp;creativeASIN=0596101996"><em>Javascript: The Definitive Guide</em></a> (using his amazon associates link),Â  where he states that IE implementation of the attributes array,"makes it impossible to use this feature portably."Â  He doesn't mention which version of IE (this specific line of code worked in IE6, IE7, and IE8a), but I figured I'd go with the more general version.

If you read this, I hope I could save you a bit of time.

P.S. - I used IE8a's Debugger to help.Â  Here's hoping they develop it further before the standard release.Â  It's MUCH better than flying blind, but I can't imagine a less helpful message than specifying an object in the console, and seeing "{...}".]]></Content>

Click image for details." alt="Photo by Vidiot. Click image for details." align="right" border="0" vspace="12" width="240" height="162" hspace="12" /></a>Happy July 4th!Â  Now, with that out of the way...

My sister Tania was at the <a href="http://www.nathansfamous.com/PageFetch/getpage.php?pgid=38">Nathan's Hot Dog eating competition</a> today.Â  She was happy with the result, I was rooting for Kobayashi.Â  Oh well.Â  My roommate was rather disgusted by the whole thing.Â  Me?Â  I found myself <em>REALLY</em> wanting a hot dog.

Speaking of food... my roommate and I were flipping channels the other day and she insisted on stopping on the food network.Â  They had a show on about local resturants known only to locals.Â  The first part was on a place I've passed countless numbers of times, called <a href="http://www.chapspitbeef.com/">Chaps Charcoal Resturant</a>. It looked pretty good, and the prices are good, so I may have to visit soon.

Since I'm on a food kick at the moment, one more... this may also soon become <a href="http://bitten.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/07/01/my-new-favorite-thing/">my favorite thing</a>.Â  Gotta try it.

Elsewhere...

The <a href="http://www.boston.com/sports/baseball/redsox/articles/2008/07/04/lester_pitches_5_hitter_red_sox_end_5_game_skid/">Sox won, beating the Yankees today</a>, but are still behind the Rays.Â  If the Rays suffer injuries down the stretch, they'll fall.Â  However, that seems to be a big if.Â  The Red Sox need to get a number of people back.

AndÂ  more locally...

When I have some free moments, I've been working rebuilding <a href="http://www.gbyo.com">gbyo.com</a> in <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>.Â  The programming part isn't particularly hard (despite not being familiar with Python... though, it's not unlike other languages), and I kinda like the <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/db-api/">database API</a> (It's been a while, so I only barely remember <a href="http://wiki.rubyonrails.org/rails/pages/ActiveRecord">ActiveRecord</a>, but I seem to like this more).Â  The thing I haven't grasped yet is overall project structure.Â  I'm working on that.

I've bought a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Iterating-Infusion-Clearer-Objects-Classes/dp/1590595378">number</a> of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Making-Web-Work-Designing-Applications/dp/0735711968">books</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/How-Solve-Heuristics-Zbigniew-Michalewicz/dp/3540660615">recently</a>, and hope to start reading them soon.Â  Right now, I am reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Learning-Website-Development-Technologies-Solutions/dp/1847193358">this</a>, as <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/">the publishers</a> were nice enough to send me a review copy.Â  Review coming soon.Â  Additionally, I want to post some <a href="http://realtech.burningbird.net/learning-javascript/basics/javascript-the-good-parts">more formal thoughts</a> about Crockford's Javascript book soon. (Note: yes, that first linked book cost me .48 cents, w/o shipping)

I'm trying to convince people to go on vacation with me.Â  So far, I haven't heard back from anyone.Â  That will only stall me, it will not deter me.]]></Content>

		<Title><![CDATA[Review of &#8220;Learning Website Development with Django&#8221;]]></Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.packtpub.com/django-website-development-tutorial/book"><img src="http://www.eddiewelker.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/learningwebsitedjango.jpg" title="Cover, Learning Website Development with Django" alt="Cover, Learning Website Development with Django" align="left" border="0" hspace="12" vspace="12" /></a>Over the past few weeks, I've been playing around with Django.Â  Because of that, I've been looking at a few different books on the subject.Â  I first started out with the <a href="http://www.djangobook.com/en/1.0/">Django Book</a>, which took me a few days to read.Â  I can't say I absorbed it all, but I got the general idea.Â  Then I decided to look into other books and found <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/django-website-development-tutorial/book"><em>Learning Website Development with Django</em></a>, by <a href="http://aymanh.com/">Ayman Hourieh</a>. Â  I started right away.

The book's subtitle, "<em>A beginner's tutorial to building web applications, quickly and cleanly, with the Django application framework</em>," frames the book perfectly.Â  Its target audience is programmers (moderately) familiar with Python, but who are, at the same time, new to Django.Â  The book is really focused towards this audience.Â  The other key word in the subtitle is "quickly."Â  This book moves along in a hurry while creating the demonstration app.Â  I was quite comfortable (and pleased) by the pace, however, I can imagine that a more novice programmer may have a harder time dealing with the information flying by.

The book centers on building one app, a social bookmarking website similar to <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a>, or ma.gnolia.Â  I think type of site was a good choice, since it provides the author with a varying degree of complexity to play around with.Â  It allowed Mr. Hourieh to start with the basics.Â  This book succeeds in starting simple and getting harder as it goes along.Â  I also thought it was good to focus on creating just one website, rather than a bunch of mini-projects or examples, since it models a more real-life situation.Â  The idea of a social bookmarking website, as well, is very useful because its features are currently <em>en vogue</em>, and can be found on many current sites.

Chapters One and Two are the obligatory "what is Django" and "how to install" chapters.Â  The meat of the book starts in Chapter Three when the project is introduced.Â Â  By the end of this third chapter, we've already quickly written three database models (Links, Users, and Bookmarks) and the main page.Â  Chapter Four introduces Django's built-in user authentication system (django.contrib.auth), and describes how to write login, logout, and registration pages.Â  Chapter Five instructs us to write an additional database model (tags), which is more complex than the models we wrote previously.Â  Here we also write pages to display the list of bookmarks, bookmarks by tags, and a tag cloud.Â  [To illustrate how fast we're moving, Chapter Five ends on page 91]

Mr. Hourieh adds occasional asides throughout <em>Learning Website Development with Django, </em>such as one on security at the end of Chapter Five.Â  Personally, I'd have liked to see more of these, but I think he consciously limited the number to better suit the book's audience.

Chapter Six introduces <st1:city><st1:place>AJAX</st1:place></st1:city> behaviors, using the jQuery library.Â  The author includes a lightning-fast tutorial on jQuery.Â  The reader is then shown how to implement a live search display, in-place bookmark editing, and a tag auto-complete feature.Â  Chapter Seven adds both a voting and commenting system to our application.Â  The user writes a new database model (Shared Bookmark), and shows how to implement comments piggy-backing on Django's built-in comment system (django.contrib.comments).

In Chapter Eight, we are finally introduced to Django's built-in Administration Interface (django.contrib.admin), and the reader is shown how to customize the admin pages and deal with user permissions.Â  Chapter Nine describes adding RSS feeds, Pagination, and advanced search capabilities to our application.Â  We're taught how to create advanced model queries using both the objects.filter() function and Q objects to build multi-faceted queries.

Chapter Ten focuses on adding a "Friend" data model to the application.Â  This chapter demonstrates how Django can be used to send email (friend 'invites' in this case), and how the bookmark application can be used to handle activation links.Â  Chapter Eleven covers three topics; language translation, caching, and unit testing.Â  None of these are as "flashy" as the previously covered topics, but they are given adequate mention. The final chapter, Chapter Twelve mentions a number of advanced topics that the reader is left to research on his/her own.

The book is generally well written.Â  I like the structure.Â  The chapter beginnings outline a plan for implementation, and the remainders proceede step-by-step.Â  I would have liked the writing to have been polished a little more.Â  The language seems too formal in places, and when you mix in a number of technical ideas, the language can distract.Â  This however, may just be a personal preference.

The more I think about <em>Learning Website Development with Django</em>, the more I like it.Â  It is well suited for someone who wants to get off the ground quickly; someone who needs to get something done and can worry about the details when they need to.Â  It's not a bible, but it's not trying to be, and I think that's where it really succeeds.]]></Content>

		<Title>Le Tour</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[<p align="left">I've been following <a href="http://www.letour.fr/">Le Tour</a> again this year.Â  Previously, the aerial shots of France kept my attention, but this year I have been interested in theÂ  competition.Â  I've found the mini-goals and side stories are as good as the goal of <em>le maillot jeune</em>.<img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3286/2666603321_2c10b6c79c_m_d.jpg" title="Le Tour" alt="Le Tour" align="right" border="0" height="160" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="240" /></p>
Anyway, I try to avoid re-posting the "hot link of the day" type linksâ€”the ones that have been passed around on other blogsâ€”but the Boston Globe's <a href="http://www.boston.com/bigpicture/2008/07/2008_tour_de_france.html">Big Picture blog</a> is worth it... just take a look at those photos.Â  This <a href="http://blog.flickr.net/en/2008/07/16/tour-de-france-2/">set from the flickr blog</a> is also pretty cool.

Still not enough? <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/t/tour_de_france_bicycle_race/index.html">Follow tour coverage</a> from the New York Times.]]></Content>

		<Title>Clean room!</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[Last weekend, I FINALLY had a chance to clean my room, and I'm pleased with the results.Â  Really, though, this post is just an excuse to do one of those "this is my desk, this is my bookshelf" posts that everyone seems to do.Â  :)

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ed_welker/2678365341/" title="Top of bookshelf #1 by eddie.welker, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3055/2678365341_976fc6f181.jpg" title="Top of bookshelf #1" alt="Top of bookshelf #1" border="0" height="375" width="500" /></a>

My favorite books are mostly at the top (actually, there's no rhyme or reason to any of it).Â  Just looking, I realize that there are a bunch of Ruby books that I almost never look at. The orange book behind the wire on the top shelf is a really good <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Introductory-Graph-Theory-Gary-Chartrand/dp/0486247759/">Dover book on Graph Theory</a>.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ed_welker/2679182862/" title="My Desk by eddie.welker, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3047/2679182862_8e2a225be4.jpg" title="My Desk" alt="My Desk" border="0" height="351" width="500" /></a>

My monitor setup.Â  I've got 3 computers, the laptop, my 'frankenmac' desktop, and a pc.Â  The frankenmac is dying, so I am probably going to have to shift things around.Â  I don't have a plan for which computer will go with which monitor, but the desk is now set, and won't change.Â  I've got my new <a href="http://www.griffintechnology.com/products/elevator">Griffin Elevator</a> sitting there.Â  I'm happy with it, keeps the bottom of the laptop really cool.

Anyway, it's been a week... let's see how clean I can keep it.]]></Content>

		<Title>Review of â€œWeb Form Design, Filling in the Blanksâ€</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[<blockquote>â€œForms suck.Â  If you donâ€™t believe me, try to find people who like filling them in.â€</blockquote>
Are you kidding, I paid for a book that begins like that?Â  My first reaction was that I could have written that!Â  Well I didnâ€™t write it, and I also feel that I got my moneyâ€™s worth out of <a href="http://www.rosenfeldmedia.com/books/webforms/"><em>Web Form Design, Filling in the Blanks</em></a>, by <a href="http://www.lukew.com/">Luke Wroblewski</a>.<img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2215/2456180445_223bf5342c_m.jpg" title="Cover of Web Form Design" alt="Cover of Web Form Design" align="right" border="0" height="240" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="160" />

Forms are hard.Â  I donâ€™t think I need to mention how hard they can be for usersâ€¦ nor do I need to mention whatâ€™s at stake if a user finds your form too difficult.Â  Every web developer who doesnâ€™t have his/her head in the clouds should know that.Â  Forms, however, are also very difficult to create... <em>correctly!</em>Â  A well designed form requires a lot of careful, detailed thought.Â  You have so much to considerâ€¦ usability issues, accessibility issues, and you usually donâ€™t have anything to go on except for your personal experience.Â  This book will help you methodically approach form design, and give you the experience of an expert to guide your decisions.

<em>Web Form Design</em> is useful, because Mr. Wroblewski takes a very detailed approach to each aspect of form design.Â  Within each chapter, he thoroughly analyzes the major elements to consider when designing a form.Â Â  For example, the chapter on â€œActionsâ€ is devoted to action items such as submit and cancel buttons.Â  One of the sub-sections discusses where to place these items on the page.Â  The author first presents the reader with the following image demonstrating all of the reasonable placements for the submit and cancel actions.

<img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2238/2366430953_c7366dc3eb.jpg" title="Figure from Web Form Design" alt="Figure from Web Form Design" border="0" height="500" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="281" />

Using eye-tracking and usability data, he then discusses the pros and cons of each arrangement, without ever deciding one is better then all others.Â  This is key because it lets the reader, knowledge in hand, decide his/her own course of action.

The book is especially valuable because of the user data, eye-tracking data, and case studies presented within. Mr. Wroblewskiâ€™s backs his reasoning with either a summary of these tests or with an example culled from his experiences.Â  He reinforces his points with a number of demonstration images, all available from the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rosenfeldmedia/sets/72157604272550634/">bookâ€™s flickr page</a>.Â  Then he includes a short â€œbest practicesâ€ section to close each chapter, outlining what was discussed.Â  These can be used almost as checklists.Â  Interspersed in the text are sidebars which present real-life examples and perspectives from numerous field authorities.

<em>Web Form Design</em> is written well enough so that it can be easily read within a few hours.Â  However, itâ€™s real place is beside you the next time that you have to design or write a form, so that you will be able to make intelligent design decisions, rather than just best guesses.]]></Content>

		<Title>Funny thing about bugs...</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[They just keep popping up.

I just scrolled down my own blog, and saw a post titled "Down to three bugs."Â  Funny enough, three months later, we're still trying to push the website out. (Wow, those were some really big bugs!!!Â  Haha, jk...)Â  In fact, I've been <em>pressing</em> for the last 2 days, trying to expedite a few last-minute bugs so that QA testing could begin (for about the 18th time, now in snapshot 21).Â  Kinda odd, when QA finds bugs in round 20 that they didn't find in round 10... despite no code changes in the meantime...

But I'm not going to complain.Â  Programming is still a lot of fun <em>when you're actually doing it</em>.Â  It ends up being almost therapeutic when you've got other stuff going on that you're trying to ignore.Â  Not only that, but there's always room to improve.Â  A co-worker came to my desk yesterday and schooled me on how to write code.Â  When you're young, you're stupid.Â  He had lots of experience, and was... well, right... most of the time.Â  I was boxed into a corner at some points, but also made a few bad decisions.Â  The good thing is that I always learn from my mistakes, and next time will be <em>much</em> better.

I remember writing 3.5 websites before I really got common code working the way I wanted.Â  It was similar to the way I learned how to write CSS.Â  Excerpting common code so that I would only edit once, vs. editing 6 files just to make one update.Â  It was easy when I was using CSS, SSI's, or PHP includes to simply import exactly what I needed, but I find it is far more difficult when using XSLT's.Â  Why?Â  Because in XSLT you need to know not only the structure, but the <em>context</em>.Â  That's what makes it difficult... writing context dependent generic code is difficult.

[Of course, dirty secret (I know you're skimming at this point, not really reading) is that I'm almost on only my 2 year anniversary (Sept. 20) of doing programming/development work.Â  So my progress is still quite good.]

Alright, I admit that this post was far more stream-of-conciousness than actual post, but it was good for me.Â  It wasn't intended to be a "I haven't written in a month, here's what I've been doing" post, but more a "I'm busy, I'll be back soon, but I don't know when" type post.Â  So on that note...

[I think it's <a href="http://www.vamp.org/Siouxsie/Images/">Siouxsie</a> that's making me intentionally ambiguous. ]

Ta ta!

		<Title>Snapshot of right now</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[Oct. 8, 2009 - 12:32am

Right now I'm...

Sitting on my bed reading the <a href="http://www.bartleby.com/87/" target="_self">Fannie Farmer Cookbook</a> (my favorite) on how to bake a 9.25lb ham.Â  Page 201. Remembering how I tell everyone they can't take it into the kitchen, because I don't want it getting dirty.

Thinking about how I need a roasting pan, which I should have grabbed when I was in Laurel, picking up my new camera lens from UPS. Thinking about how I waited 45 minutes for it, when I probably should have had it re-delivered.Â  Also thinking that the roasting pan may be too large for my oven here.

Listening to George Crumb's <a href="http://www.georgecrumb.net/comp/ancien.html" target="_self"><em>Ancient Voices of Children</em></a>.Â  Wishing it drowned out more of "The Shield," the program my roommates are watching/listening to.Â  Thinking how much I like <em>Ancient Voices of Children</em>, despite how weird some of the sounds are.

Finished taking a few play photos with the new lens. <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/ed_welker/">Posted them to flickr</a>.Â  Wondering if every good lens makes it this easy, which should I purchase next?Â  Thinking I made a good choice to start.

Wondering if I will have any clean sock pairs left for me to wear to work tomorrow.

Resisting falling asleep, so I can formally get ready for sleep instead.]]></Content>

		<Title>October Horror Movies</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[My roommates and I have decided to try to watch a horror/thriller every night of October.Â  Unfortunately, the Red Sox and a few other distractions have prevented watching one <em>every</em> night, but here's what we've got so far:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119791/">Nightwatch</a> - Not a fan of this movie.Â  I thought that the scary parts were kinda cheap, and that the plot of the movie was gross (really gross) for the sake of being gross.Â  That gets under my skin faster than just about anything.Â  Plus, what's the point of a movie where the number of possible suspects is 2? As Rick points out, one of the biggest hit/miss parts of <em>Scream</em> was that there were 15 possible suspects. That's much more interesting.Â  This was Alissa's pick.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070698/">Sisters</a> - A psychological horror movie about two Siamese twins that were separated after a number of years and the emotional result of that operation. Very spooky, in a thought-required way.Â  This movie was my pick.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080661/">Dressed to Kill</a> - Continuing on the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000361/">Brian De Palma</a> theme... I'm a sucker for Michael Caine.Â  So I really enjoyed his performance.Â  The rest of the movie had a really constant quality to it that wasn't quite eerie, but was close.Â  Unfortunately, I fell asleep during part of the film (not long...) but I liked it anyway.Â  This was Rick's choice.</li>
</ul>
And upon consultation with them (I had to ask just to be certain) that was it.Â  They watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101540/">Cape Fear</a> without me (I've seen it before), but even still... 4 movies in 16 days isn't good enough.

Other movies that I remember are on our combined list:
<ul>
	<li>Alien</li>
	<li>The Shining</li>
	<li>Feast*</li>
	<li>Carrie*</li>
	<li>Hellraiser I &amp; II</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059646/">Repulsion</a>* (one of the scariest I've ever seen, and one of my favs)</li>
</ul>
* I've seen (and loved)]]></Content>

		<Title><![CDATA[Review of "Object-Oriented JavaScript"]]></Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.packtpub.com/object-oriented-javascript-applications-libraries/book"><img class="size-full wp-image-125 alignleft" style="margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;" title="Object Oriented JavaScript" src="http://www.eddiewelker.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/objectorientedjavascript.jpg" alt="Object Oriented JavaScript" width="225" height="286" /></a>

I recently read <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/object-oriented-javascript-applications-libraries/book">Object-Oriented JavaScript</a>, by <a href="http://www.phpied.com/">Stoyan Stefanov</a>.  In reviewing it, I found it was one of the most interesting books I've read in a while, for some good reasons and a few more curious reasons.

Object-Oriented JavaScript was authored by Mr. Stefanov, who is a developer at Yahoo.  It features an impressive number of reviewers (twelve), among them <a href="http://www.crockford.com/">Douglas Crockford</a>, the author of <a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596517748/"><em>JavaScript: The Good Parts</em></a>, and <a href="http://techfoolery.com/">Ross Harmes</a>, author of <a href="http://www.apress.com/book/view/159059908x"><em>JavaScript Design Patterns</em></a>, both of whom are Stefanov's Yahoo co-workers.  In a reasonable 330 pages, it features eight chapters on JavaScript's History, Basic Syntax/Features, Functions, Objects, Prototypes, Inheritance, the DOM, and Patterns/Best Practices.

Readers with little to no JavaScript knowledge will be able to read this book, but I'm uncertain how much they'll be able to glean from the meaty inner chapters (functions, objects, prototypes, and inheritance).  Readers with moderate JavaScript understanding should be able to learn a great deal from this book.  At the very least, advanced readers should be reminded of some of the language's quirkier parts, as well as benefiting from an organized chapter on inheritance techniques.

It is tricky placing Object-Oriented JavaScript in context of the corpus of JavaScript literature.  This book includes more than a little introductory material (chapters 1-2), while the core chapters (3-6) are way beyond an introduction.  Only after those chapters (which I will discuss in a second) is the reader introduced briefly to the DOM and XHR before a chapter on design patterns and best practices.  At a minimum, every chapter is useful and full of hints that are difficult to <em>grep</em> from run-of-the-mill JavaScript books. The book steers clear of the murky world of browser differences unless they're pertinent to the topic of Object-Oriented JavaScript, which seems perfectly acceptable.

Back to those middle chapters, they are sheer gold.  I am going force myself to make time to re-read this book, if not those chapters alone.  They present, in a clear and organized fashion, many difficult aspects of the language, including closures, prototype, and 12 different methods for inheritance.  In comparison, I believe Harmes' book isn't as well organized, and Crockford's book isn't as clear. Stefanov doesn't break much new ground here, but the clarity describing these techniques is quite valuable regardless.

Object-Oriented JavaScript appears occasionally try to be something to everyone.  This is kind of disappointing, since I would have <span style="text-decoration: underline;">loved</span> to have seen any additional discussion or insight the author could have offered in the core chapters.  There are tons of introductory JavaScript books, so I don't know what a book titled Object-Oriented JavaScript gains by including more introduction. This shouldn't detract from the book's overall value.  All of the chapters are well written and useful.  However as a reader gains a better understanding of JavaScript, the introductory chapters will become far less useful, while the other chapters will remain an excellent reference.

In my mind, the three best JavaScript books are Flanagan's <em>JavaScript The Definitive Guide</em>, Crockford's <em>JavaScript: The Good Parts</em>, and Harmes' and [Dustin] Diaz's <em>Pro JavaScript Design Patterns</em>.  Object-Oriented JavaScript doesn't belong in that company for the reasons mentioned above.  However, I would easily give it fourth place, and recommend it as a clear description of JavaScript's harder parts.]]></Content>

		<Title>More October Horror Movies</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[Continuing the reviews of my house's October horror movie film-fest:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0289043/">28 Days Later</a> - Rick told me that this was among the most realistic zombie movies ever made.Â  While it had a realistic look and feel, I had a problem with the unrealistic (and porous) plot line.Â  Of the 4 or so main characters, the supporting father and daughter roles were sympathetic, but I cared nothing for the main male and female leads.Â  That would be fine, if I didn't also have to care about the weak plot (and yes, I know we're talking about a zombie movie, but still!).Â  I didn't dislike the movie, but it wasn't my favorite.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093177/">Hellraiser</a> - I've been excited about watching this ever since I first heard <a href="http://www.brainwashed.com/common/htdocs/discog/coil1.html">the (rejected) soundtrack by Coil</a>.Â  It was well worth it.Â  The movie's imagery was pure 80's (a compliment) and quite realistic, compared to the only-special-effects imagery I'm used to after watching modern movies. I won't soon forget the rats nailed to the walls.Â  Hoping I can sneak Hellraiser II in before Halloween.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081505/">The Shining</a> - I'm sure I don't need to mention how this movie helps to define the horror genre.Â  It's spooky, creepy, and maintains the feeling that things are about to descend into total chaos for so long that you're exhausted by the end.Â  My only problem is that the Simpson's parody is so good that's all I could think of at times.Â  Teriffic movie.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0426459/">Feast</a> - Ok, I didn't get all the way through this last night, but I've seen it (a few times) before.Â  It doesn't take itself too seriously, and is a quintessential example of a trashy, gorey, funny horror movie.Â  You'd think the end woud be a let-down after how front-heavy the action is, but you'd be wrong.</li>
</ul>]]></Content>

		<Title>Next-to-last Horror Movies</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[Latest installment...
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0051418/">The Blob</a> - Pure 60's cheese (well, technically 1958, but close enough). Not scary, more silly than anything else. I was amazed that at one point, there was 24 minutes of no blobbing. Instead, we were shown a nearly 30 year old McQueen pretending to be a high schooler.Â  At least I can say I've seen it once.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095294/">Hellbound: Hellraiser II</a> - I had heard (multiple times) that this lived up to, if not surpassed, the original.Â  I didn't quite think that was true.Â  [spoiler] I didn't like Pinhead reverting to a human and dying.Â  A hero has an air of invincibility, and a super-villain (from hell no less) should be the same.Â  The plot set him up against the true villain of this movie, and Pinhead lost.Â  What a shame.Â  That said, it was immensely psychological, and quite a captivating movie (we were all watching with baited breath throughout). I thought it was terrific, just not as good as the first.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103873/">Dead Alive</a> - What can you say about a movie like that? Tons of gore and grossness, with only a hint of a plot. It is indeed a "classic." Did I like it?Â  Ehh, it was ok... but I can appreciate it, especially viewed through the eyes of others.</li>

		<Title>Horror Movies, Final installment</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[The final installment... a little late.
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078767/">Amityville Horror</a> - (The OLD one, not the new one.)Â  I'd watched this before, but it was so much better than I remember it.Â  In fact, I felt it was the scariest movie that I ended up watching.Â  The scene at the beginning where the priest goes into the house was totally blood chilling.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0251736/">House of 1000 Corpses</a> - I waited for years to see this movie, only to end up kinda disappointed.Â  I figured Rob Zombie had to know what he was doing with a horror movie, but the plot was so off-the-wall that I couldn't believe anything, resulting in my rather ambivalent feeling towards it.Â  Too many characters killing too many other characters.Â  The creepy clown was the only interesting/memorable character.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0395584/">The Devil's Rejects</a> - I also waited a number of years to see this movie, but was prevented under the reasoning that I had to see House of 1000 Corpses first.Â  With that finally out of the way, I was now allowed, but I was wary... especially after the last film.Â  For the Devil's Rejects, Rob Zombie took the large number of characters and un-realistic plot from the first movie, and turned it on it's head... keeping the cast numbers low and keeping the entire movie realistic.Â  Zombie made the 3 bad guys out to be quasi-good guys, andÂ the cop into a revenge obsessed bad guy.Â  The result was a really good character study of some truly bizarre people.Â  This movie wasn't particularly scary, but it was quite good.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074285/">Carrie</a> - One of the best scary movies ever... my favorite part is at the end where Carrie's hand... well, you know.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070047/">The Exorcist</a> - I LOVE this movie. I saved this pick until Halloween night. I love Max von Sydow, the early scenes in the desert, Father Damien, the fact that the movie is based on something that happened in a part of Maryland I frequent, that the movie's steps are right down the street from where I used to work in Georgetown.Â  My favorite.</li>

		<Title>Advantages of push-style XSLT over pull-style</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[Working with more than a few new-hires over the last few weeks, I've noticed that new XSLT developers often write pull-style XSLTs by default.  However, this tends to defy XSLT's functional heritage, and is not as useful as the opposite form, push-style XSLTs.

Pull-style XSLTs reach into the source document and pull out the data they need to transform.  The pull-style is similar to template systems like those found in Rails or Django, or inserting PHP commands between HTML elements. For example, given the trivial input:

<pre lang="xml">
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<books>
    <book>
        <title>The Scheme Programming Language</title>
        <author>R. Kent Dybvig</author>
    </book>
    <book>
        <title>Essentials of Programming Languages</title>
        <author>Daniel P. Friedman</author>
    </book>
    <book>
        <title>An Introduction to Information Theory</title>
        <author>John R. Pierce</author>
    </book>
</books>
</pre>

an XSLT novice will produce a stylesheet like the following (note lines 11 and 12 which reach into the source and grab the data):

<pre lang="xml" line="1">
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<xsl:stylesheet xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform" version="1.0">
    <xsl:template match="/">
        <html>
            <head>
                <title>books</title>
            </head>
            <body>
                <dl>
                    <xsl:for-each select="books/book">
                        <dt><xsl:value-of select="title"/></dt>
                        <dd><xsl:value-of select="author"/></dd>
                    </xsl:for-each>
                </dl>
            </body>
        </html>
    </xsl:template>
</xsl:stylesheet>
</pre>

which transforms into:

<pre lang="xml">
<html>
   <head>
      <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
      <title>books</title>

</pre>

The real power of XSLT, however, is defining templates for the elements found within the source document. These are push-style XSLTs.  They have two main advantages.  First, push-style gracefully handles complex source structures, including recursively nested elements.  It would be near impossible to handle the following source document using pull-style,

<pre lang="xml">
<div><div><div>a</div></div></div>
</pre>

if you didn't know how deep the recursive divs would go. A push-style solution, though, is incredibly simple.

<pre lang="xml">
<xsl:template match="div">
     * <xsl:apply-templates/> *
</xsl:template>
</pre>

Will transform the previous source into the following.

<pre>* * * a * * *</pre>

In addition to handling complex source structures, push-style allows code reuse.  This is of course an ideal of any programming language.  Push-style XSLTs have a greater ability to be reused, because the individual templates can be reused.  When you only have one template, it is quite difficult to make it general without resorting to numerous choose-when statements.  Here is an example of code reuse, where we extend a previously written template with the xsl:apply-imports rule.

Given the input,

<pre lang="xml">
<images>
    <image>
        <url>http://www.filmjunkie.com/drinks/blixa/blixa.jpg</url>
        <alt>Blixa!</alt>
    </image>
</images>
</pre>

and the XSLTs,

<pre lang="xml">
    <xsl:import href="imageformat.xsl"/>
    
    <xsl:template match="image">
        <div class="wrapper">
            <xsl:apply-imports/>
        </div>
    </xsl:template>
</pre>

and the rule in "imageformat.xsl" (the template being extended in this case),

<pre lang="xml">
    <xsl:template match="image">
        <img src="{url}" alt="{alt_text}"/>
    </xsl:template>
</pre>

the processor will apply the higher-precedence template first, and then apply the imported (and lower-precedence) template to yield the following output.

<pre lang="xml">
<div class="wrapper">
    <img src="http://www.filmjunkie.com/drinks/blixa/blixa.jpg" alt="Blixa!"/>
<div>
</pre>

Push-style XSLTs are not the most obvious thing to pick up unless you've been exposed to a functional programming language like Lisp or Scheme. However, considering their great value, they should be among the first disciplines studied when learning XSLT. ]]></Content>

		<Content><![CDATA[I don't typically link to other blogs/articles, nor do I mention classical music particularly often, but I found this article and blog entry so interesting and thought-provoking that they deserve a re-post.

First, <a href="http://davidfinlayson.typepad.com/fin_notes/2008/12/some-words-about-gilbert-kaplan.html">a moving blog entry</a> from <a href="http://nyphil.org/meet/orchestra/index.cfm?page=profile&amp;personNum=14" target="_blank">David Finlayson</a>, trombonist in the New York Philharmonic, and second, the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/18/arts/music/18kapl.html?_r=1&amp;hp">New York Times article</a> describing the background, as well as referencing the <a href="http://davidfinlayson.typepad.com/fin_notes/2008/12/some-words-about-gilbert-kaplan.html">blog post</a>.

While I've never had a specifically parallel experience, I can relate to the concepts of "fakes" in a particular industry.Â  I find Mr. Finlayson's reaction (that all musicians must take responsibility and blame for the situation) to be both bold, yet... well, correct.Â  It takes a strong person to identify a stormy situation clearly and react in an appropriate fashion.Â  I only hope that I would react the same way given the circumstanses.]]></Content>

		<Title>My XSLT Toolbox - copy and copy-of</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[Using XSLT to copy elements is extremely common when you're transforming a source document of a certain type (XML, HTML, etc.) to the same type.  Often, you need an exact copy of an element verbatim, but other times you need to selectively choose certain elements to copy and others to discard.  XSLT makes this process quite elegant using it's xsl:copy-of and xsl:copy elements.  The following is a setp-by-step tutorial on how these elements are used.

When you need an exact copy of an element and it's children, you use the xsl:copy-of element, which makes an exact copy of the selected element and it's children.  Given the following XML data, which represents a (trivial) inventory of a store, let's say you want an exact copy of any items with the name "XSLT". 

<pre lang="xml">
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<inventory>
    <item id="1">
        <name>The Little Schemer</name>
        <type>book</type>
        <author>Friedman</author>
        <author>Felleisen</author>
        <list-price>29.95</list-price>
        <sell-price>26.99</sell-price>
        <cost>17.92</cost>
    </item>
    <item id="2">
        <name>XSLT</name>
        <type>book</type>
        <author>Tidwell</author>
        <list-price>49.95</list-price>
        <sell-price>34.99</sell-price>
        <cost>22.92</cost>
    </item>
    <item id="3">
        <name>Romeo and Juliet</name>
        <type>compact disc</type>
        <conductor>Rostropovich</conductor>
        <list-price>18.98</list-price>
        <sell-price>13.99</sell-price>
        <cost>9.92</cost>
    </item>
</inventory>
</pre>


You simply apply the following XSLT stylesheet to your source document:

<pre lang="xml">
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<xsl:stylesheet xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform" version="1.0">

    <xsl:template match="/">
        <xsl:copy-of select="inventory/item[name = 'XSLT']"/>
    </xsl:template>

</xsl:stylesheet>
</pre>

Which gives you exactly what you were looking for, the "item" with the name "XSLT".

<pre lang="xml">
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<item id="2">
    <name>XSLT</name>
    <type>book</type>
    <author>Tidwell</author>
    <list-price>49.95</list-price>
    <sell-price>34.99</sell-price>
    <cost>22.92</cost>
</item>
</pre>


That was easy, so now let's say you want to do a little more with your inventory document.  Your boss wants a copy of it to look at the numbers and do some accounting.  She doesn't care about the authors or conductors, so she'd like that information left out.  Also, she would like an additional piece of information for each item, the amount of profit off each item sold, the difference between the sell-price and the cost.  

Because we are adding a piece of information and getting rid of elements that don't affect the accounting, we can't use a xsl:copy-of, because that would output an exact copy of the item element, it's attribute nodes, and it's child nodes. This exact copy is called a <i>deep copy</i>, because it not only copies the element, but all of it's children as well.  The solution is to use xsl:copy which performs a <i>shallow copy</i>, which means it <b>only</b> copies the current node, and ignores all children or attribute nodes.

Since xsl:copy only copies one element at a time, you need to explicitly specify that you want to continue copying attribute nodes and child nodes.  xsl:apply-templates gives us the leverage to write a template that accomplishes that.  The following template starts by matching attribute and children nodes, then copies the node, and recursively applies itself to any attribute or child nodes found in the source tree.


<pre lang="xml">
<!-- @* matches any attribute node on the current element,
       node() matches any child nodes of the current element -->
<xsl:template match="@*|node()">
    <!-- shallow copy... 
          only copy the node you're on (be that attribute or child node) -->
    <xsl:copy>
        <!-- apply this template to any other attribute or child nodes found -->
        <xsl:apply-templates select="@*|node()"/>  
    </xsl:copy>
</xsl:template>
</pre>

Using this template, I can write a XSLT stylesheet that will copy the entire source document without any changes.  This isn't quite what we were looking for, because we wanted to add and remove child elements of item, but this is the first step.

<pre lang="xml">
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<xsl:stylesheet xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform" version="1.0">

    <xsl:template match="/">
        <xsl:apply-templates/>
    </xsl:template>
    

    <!-- copy all attribute or child nodes in place -->
    <xsl:template match="@*|node()">
        <xsl:copy>
            <xsl:apply-templates select="@*|node()"/>  
        </xsl:copy>
    </xsl:template>
    
    
</xsl:stylesheet>
</pre>


So how do we add the profit made from each item and remove the unnecessary information?  We use the fact that our xsl:match="@*|node()" template has a very low priority.  Determination of default XSLT priorities are an advanced topic I won't go into right now, but feel free to <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt#conflict">explore the topic</a> if <a href="http://www.dpawson.co.uk/xsl/sect2/N7654.html#d11689e235">you are interested</a>.  Our template is essentially given a priority of -.5.  Templates such as xsl:template match="foo", however, are given a default priority of 0.  Because templates matching element names are higher priority, we can easily figure out how to remove the "author" and "conductor" elements, just declare templates without outputs!

<pre lang="xml">
<xsl:template match="author"/>
<xsl:template match="conductor"/>
</pre>

We use the same technique to add an element to our "item" elements.  First we use xsl:copy to copy the item node itself.  Then we apply-templates to any attribute or children nodes found.  When an author or conductor element is found, it will match our explicit rules and produce no output, therefore they will not be copied into our result.  Finally, we create a new element named "profit" which will contain the difference between the sell-price and the cost.

<pre lang="xml">
<xsl:template match="item">
    <xsl:copy>
        <xsl:apply-templates select="@*|node()"/>
        <profit><xsl:value-of select="(sell-price - cost)"/></profit>
    </xsl:copy>
</xsl:template>
</pre>

So we arrive at our final XSLT stylesheet, which looks like this:

<pre lang="xml">
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<xsl:stylesheet xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform" version="1.0">

    <xsl:template match="/">
        <xsl:apply-templates/>
    </xsl:template>
    
    <!-- for each item, copy the <item> element, and apply-templates
         to it's attributes and children. Finally, create a <profit> 
         element, the difference between the sell-price and the cost.  -->
    <xsl:template match="item">
        <xsl:copy>
            <xsl:apply-templates select="@*|node()"/>
            <profit><xsl:value-of select="(sell-price - cost)"/></profit>
        </xsl:copy>
    </xsl:template>
    
    <!-- don't copy these, when they're found, there is no output -->
    <xsl:template match="author"/>
    <xsl:template match="conductor"/>

    <!-- copy all attribute or child nodes in place -->
    <xsl:template match="@*|node()">
        <xsl:copy>
            <xsl:apply-templates select="@*|node()"/>  
        </xsl:copy>
    </xsl:template>
    
    
</xsl:stylesheet>
</pre>

When applied to our source document, we get the result our boss wanted, it excludes any "author" or "composer" elements, and includes a "profit" element.

<pre lang="xml">
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<inventory>
    <item id="1">
        <name>The Little Schemer</name>
        <type>book</type>
        <list-price>29.95</list-price>
        <sell-price>26.99</sell-price>
        <cost>17.92</cost>
        <profit>9.07</profit>
    </item>
    <item id="2">
        <name>XSLT</name>
        <type>book</type>
        <list-price>49.95</list-price>
        <sell-price>34.99</sell-price>
        <cost>22.92</cost>
        <profit>12.07</profit>
    </item>
    <item id="3">
        <name>Romeo and Juliet</name>
        <type>compact disc</type>
        <list-price>18.98</list-price>
        <sell-price>13.99</sell-price>
        <cost>9.92</cost>
        <profit>4.07</profit>
    </item>
</inventory>
</pre>

Using this technique, we can then easily prepare another XSLT stylesheet to generate an inventory list for the customer, which will exclude the "cost" element, since we don't want them knowing it!  All we need is to match all attribute and children nodes and copy them as normal, while providing no output when the XSLT processor encounters a "cost" element.

<pre lang="xml">
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<xsl:stylesheet xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform" version="1.0">

    <xsl:template match="/">
        <xsl:apply-templates/>
    </xsl:template>
    
    
    <!-- don't copy the cost, the customer doesn't need to know! -->
    <xsl:template match="cost"/>


    <!-- copy all attribute or child nodes in place -->
    <xsl:template match="@*|node()">
        <xsl:copy>
            <xsl:apply-templates select="@*|node()"/>  
        </xsl:copy>
    </xsl:template>
    
</xsl:stylesheet>
</pre>

Personally, because I end up transforming XML sources to XML output, I end up using xsl:copy-of and xsl:template match="@*|node()" all the time.  In fact, xsl:template match="@*|node()" just happens to be the first piece of code in my XSLT toolbox.]]></Content>

		<Title>My XSLT Toolbox - Recursive XSLT templates</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[Recursion is one of the core concepts in programming.  It's valuable not only as a technique for writing programs, but as a general concept for solving problems.  XSLT provides many useful elements such as for-each (and apply-templates), but occasionally you will run into a problem which must be solved with recursion.  Let's take a look at a real-world (no Fibonacci!!) example, where we have to operate on a simple string of numbers separated by commas.  We'll take a step-by-step approach to writing a recursive template. 

Let's say we have the following source document, short and sweet.  We want to take each number, and wrap it with an element.

<pre lang="xml">
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<comma>1,2,3,4,5,6,7,88,99,100</comma>
</pre>

The easy way to do this is to use the <a href="http://www.exslt.org/str/functions/tokenize/">EXSLT str:tokenize function</a>, which takes a string and some delimiters and splits the string based on those delimiters. All we do is add the xmlns:str and extension-element-prefixes attributes to our xsl:stylesheet declaration, and then call the str:tokenize function.

<pre lang="xml">
<xsl:stylesheet xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform" 
version="1.0" xmlns:str="http://exslt.org/strings" 
extension-element-prefixes="str">

    <xsl:template match="/>
        <xsl:for-each select="str:tokenize( comma, ',')">
            <xsl:copy-of select="."/>
        </xsl:for-each>
    </xsl:template>

</xsl:stylesheet>
</pre>

The result is, (new-lines added for readability):

<pre lang="xml">
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<token>1</token>
<token>2</token>
<token>3</token>
<token>4</token>
<token>5</token>
<token>6</token>
<token>7</token>
<token>88</token>
<token>99</token>
<token>100</token>
</pre>

Excellent. But let's say that we don't have access to the EXSLT functions, and we have to write a template to perform the same thing.  

So now we think up a recursive algorithm.  Let's look at a simplified list with three numbers, such as "1,2,3".  First, we print the "1", the value before the first comma, and then we discard the first comma.  At that point, our list will be "2,3" and we repeat, printing the new first value, and discarding the new first comma. Finally, the list becomes only "3".  There is no comma, so we simply print out the rest of the list, "3".  So we will be recursing over the string printing the first number, and then popping off the first number and first comma.  This technique will work with a three number list, or a million-number list (though your processor will probably run out of memory before that).

XPath's "substring-before", "substring-after", and "contains" functions are all of the tools that we'll need to implement our algorithm.  "substring-before" lets us obtain the number before the first comma. "substring-after" lets us discard the first number and first comma, and "contains" allows us figure out the last, comma-less case.

Our function starts in the same manner as all recursive functions, dealing with the last case, and then all of the cases before it.  The last case will be the comma-less case from our algorithm. So here's our template skeleton.

<pre lang="xml">
    <xsl:template name="splitcommas">
        <xsl:choose>
            <xsl:when test=" not(contains($comma, ','))">
                <!-- do something -->
            </xsl:when>
            <xsl:otherwise>
                <!-- do something -->
            </xsl:otherwise>
        </xsl:choose>
    </xsl:template>
</pre>

We use the XPath "not(contains($comma, ','))" to, obviously, test whether our list contains a comma.  As you probably noticed, we don't actually have a $comma variable defined, so we'll add our xsl:param to the template.

<pre lang="xml">
    <xsl:template name="splitcommas">
        <xsl:param name="comma"/>
        <xsl:choose>
            <xsl:when test=" not(contains($comma, ','))">
                <!-- do something -->
            </xsl:when>
            <xsl:otherwise>
                <!-- do something -->
            </xsl:otherwise>
        </xsl:choose>
    </xsl:template>
</pre>

Now we fill in the holes in the template's framework.  First, we'll handle the comma-less case, simply outputting the value wrapped in a "value" element.

<pre lang="xml">
<value><xsl:value-of select="$comma"/></value>
</pre>

Then we will deal with the otherwise case.  We'll first print out the number before the first comma in the same manner that we printed the comma-less case.

<pre lang="xml">
<value><xsl:value-of select="substring-before($comma, ',')"/></value>
</pre>

Then we'll perform the same operation on the list after discarding the first number and first comma.  We'll call the template again, passing everything after the first comma (thus excluding both the first number and the first comma).

<pre lang="xml">
<xsl:call-template name="splitcommas">
    <xsl:with-param name="comma" select="substring-after($comma, ',')"/>
</xsl:call-template>
</pre>

Finally, we'll put all of these parts together, as well as adding a root template that will call our "splitcommas" template.

<pre lang="xml">
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<xsl:stylesheet xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform" version="1.0">

    <xsl:template match="/">
        <xsl:call-template name="splitcommas">
            <xsl:with-param name="comma" select="comma"/>
        </xsl:call-template>
    </xsl:template>
    
    <xsl:template name="splitcommas">
        <xsl:param name="comma"/>
        <xsl:choose>
            <xsl:when test=" not(contains($comma, ','))">
                <value><xsl:value-of select="$comma"/></value>
            </xsl:when>
            <xsl:otherwise>
                <value><xsl:value-of select="substring-before($comma, ',')"/></value>
                <xsl:call-template name="splitcommas">
                    <xsl:with-param name="comma" select="substring-after($comma, ',')"/>
                </xsl:call-template>
            </xsl:otherwise>
        </xsl:choose>
    </xsl:template>

</xsl:stylesheet>
</pre>

When applied to our source document, we get exactly what we wanted, each number of the string, enclosed in a <value> element (I added new-lines for readability).

<pre lang="xml">
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<value>1</value>
<value>2</value>
<value>3</value>
<value>4</value>
<value>5</value>
<value>6</value>
<value>7</value>
<value>88</value>
<value>99</value>
<value>100</value>
</pre>

So we accomplished what we were looking to accomplish by writing a recursive template, however our template only deals with commas.  What if our list was separated by spaces instead of commas?  We'd have to either write a new template that deals with spaces, or, better yet, modify our template to be more generic and handle many cases.  I invite you to take a look at the <a href="http://www.exslt.org/str/functions/tokenize/str.tokenize.template.xsl">actual implementation of the str:tokenize  function</a>.  It isn't that much more complicated, but does contain a few interesting wrinkles.

If you're interested in the basics of recursion in general, I highly recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0262560992?ie=UTF8&tag=eddwelsblo-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0262560992"><i>The Little Schemer</i></a> which is the most outstanding book I've read on the subject.]]></Content>

		<Title>My XSLT Toolbox - 5 Favorite XSLT Books</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[I love reading programming books, especially to learn a new programming language.Â  Learning XSLT, I read a large number of books, as there are quite a few available.Â  The quality of the XSLT books struck me as particularly all over the place, some were quite good while others weren't even worth the time to skim.Â  So I'm throwing together a simple list of my current collection of XSLT references, which happened to be my favorites of the bunch.Â Â  These books are all geared towards specific audiences... beginners, advanced, etc, so I included their audiences.
<ul>
	<li><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596000537?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eddwelsblo-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0596000537">XSLT - Mastering XML Transformations</a>, Doug Tidwell</strong>
This is my favorite XSLT book.Â  Mr. Tidwell did a great job of combining an introduction to the language, a tutorial on how to write XSLTs, and a reference all into one book.Â  On top of that, I found it to be written in the clearest, most conversational style I've found in many a programming book.Â  I find this book covers 90% of my day-to-day needs, and when I forget how something works, this book usually answers my questions.Â  (Plus, hey, you can get the 1.0 version for about $3 used.)</li>
	<li><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470192747?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eddwelsblo-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0470192747">XSLT: Programmer's Reference</a>, Michael Kay</strong>
If Mr. Tidwell's book covers 90%, this book covers all 100%, and then some.Â  Mr. Kay (who wrote the Saxon processor, if you weren't aware) presents what amounts to an annotated specification in book form.Â  One of my co-workers calls this book the XSLT dictionary, and I can't argue with that.Â  This book is probably best for advanced programmers.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0764547763?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eddwelsblo-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0764547763">XSLT and XPATH on the Edge</a>, Jeni Tennison</strong>
Once you've got the basics of the language down, you've got to use it to write real-world code.Â  I found this book helps to smooth down the rough edges of working with the language.Â  This book requires a mid-level familiarity with the language.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596009747?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eddwelsblo-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0596009747">XSLT Cookbook, Second Edition</a>, Salvatore Mangano</strong>
I reach for this book whenever I've got to do something weird.Â  I use it to find the solution to some odd edge case, or for my "can I do this with XSLT" questions.Â  The book covers everything from faking regular expressions, to set operations on different node-sets, to functional programming with XSLT.Â  I don't use it often, but it's like gold when I do.Â  This book is mostly for advanced users.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596002912?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eddwelsblo-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0596002912">XPath and XPointer</a>, John E. Simpson</strong>
The content in this book is totally covered in each of the other books, and it isn't really XSLT, because it only covers XPath.Â  But this book is my simple reference to 90% of the XPath questions I have.Â  It is a nice little book that I could live without, but it certainly makes my life easier having it around.Â  I think new users will likely get the most out of this book. (Another book that can be had for about $3 used.)</li>
</ul>
(For disclosure, I did make the links amazon referrals. I feel kinda weird, but figured why not. I don't expect any results, but if I got some, it'd go straight to buying a new book.)]]></Content>

		<Title><![CDATA[Review of "Expert Python Programming"]]></Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.packtpub.com/expert-python-programming/book"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-227" style="margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;" title="Expert Python Programming" src="http://www.eddiewelker.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/expertpythonprogramming.jpg" alt="Expert Python Programming" width="225" height="278" /></a>

Based on the title, <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/expert-python-programming/book">Expert Python Programming</a>, (by <a href="http://tarekziade.wordpress.com/">Tarek ZiadÃ©</a>) I had expected a book covering the Python language... syntax, advanced data structures, maybe some functional programming... stuff like that. This book surprised me.  Rather, it contains a hodgepodge of information about the world of Python development, from setting up editors to distributed version control to application distribution.  "Expert Python Programming" does contain some information on the Python language itself, but not as much as I would have hoped.  While it does contain a good amount of useful information, overall, I'd have to say that it misses the target.

Quickly summarized, the book contains 3 chapters on package management and distribution, 2 on syntax, 2 on optimization, and one each on language setup, naming conventions (style guide), version control, project management, documentation, test-driven development, and design patterns.  Based on the content, I might have titled this book "Expert Python Development Practices", and think I would have been happier reading it in that case.  The discrepancy between the title and the content is especially bothersome to me, since it would be easy to assume this book focused specifically on programming, rather than code management.

Expert Python Programming's greatest asset is the number of tools and utilities that it covers.  As a mostly casual Python programmer, there were a number of things that I learned, especially with regard to  package management and distribution.  I've never needed to build a package, and never used Atomisator or zc.buildout before, so I found these chapters rather interesting (though not personally useful at the moment). To be sure, when I need to use these, this book will the be the first place I come.

I was familiar with a decent amount of the information in the documentation, test-driven development, and style-guide chapters from reading some of the <a href="http://www.python.org/doc/">Python Documentation</a> and a few of the <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/">PEPs (Python Enahncement Proposals)</a>.  These chapters would be good for anyone who doesn't want to have to go and search for this information on their own, and I think it would be rather handy to have all of this information in one place.

The weakest part of the book were the chapters focusing on Python itself. The majority wasn't anything particularly groundbreaking here that I haven't read elsewhere, while the interesting sections, such as "How Python Deals with Memory" and "Multithreading" were short and not particularly detailed.  The sections on optimization were nice, but limited.

My only other observations were that the Mr. ZiadÃ© at times made statements of opinions that he presented as fact.  I would have preferred him presenting code as evidence towards these opinions and leaving the reader to decide for themselves.  To be fair, these moments were infrequent enough that they weren't that bothersome.

Through no fault of the author, <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/">Packt Publishing</a> did let a number of small editorial mistakes slip through.  Additionally, I found myself often wanting a better presentation of code samples. The overall design of the code examples and body text of the book ended up being quite similar, and I wish that they had made a bigger differential between the two.

Personally, I was disappointed that the Expert Python Programming's didn't feature aspects about the language as prominently as the everything else.   I can only recommend that any potential buyers of this book borrow a copy, or make a trip to the local bookstore to flip through it first.  Otherwise, this may not be the book that you were looking for.]]></Content>

		<Title><![CDATA[Review of "Prototype-Based Programming"]]></Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[<img class="size-full wp-image-235 alignleft" style="margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;" title="Prototype-Based Programming" src="http://www.eddiewelker.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/prototypebasedprogramming.png" alt="Prototype-Based Programming" width="225" height="356" />

I ran across a mention of "Prototype-Based Programming" back when I was first learning JavaScript.Â  I thought it would be an interesting read, but forgot to bookmark it, and forgot to look into it further.Â  Once I finally remembered it, it proved hard to find (and an expensive gamble from Amazon), until I found it through NIH's interlibrary loan system.

I was quite excited to get my hands on a copy of this book, I was interested in learning more about the general theory that went into languages with prototypal inheritance.Â  I thought this would allow me a special insight into JavaScript.Â  However, as I found reading it... despite it's 1999 publication date, JavaScript wasn't even mentioned in the book!Â  Regardless, I found parts of it to be quite interesting and insightful.

The book is broken up into three sections (as mentioned on the cover), Concepts, Languages, and Applications.Â  Each section has 4 associated chapters which are really various papers, some of which seem to be difficult to find elsewhere.

The first section, "Concepts" was the most interesting. The first was titled "Classes vs. Prototypes: Some Philosophical and Historical Observations."Â  This chapter provided a nice introduction to the topic, including the history of classification, going back to Aristotle and proceeding to Ludwig Wittgenstein who had an interesting example about classifying the characteristics of an item as simple as a "game".Â  It goes on to transition to a programming perspective.Â  A point that is made repeatedly throughout many chapters that the idea of classical inheritance necessitating construction from the top (superclasses) to the bottom (subclasses) is inherently contradictory to the way humans think.Â  When unfamiliar with a domain, a person can more easily deal with concrete examples, and only discern the abstract general form after discovering these patterns in the concrete cases.Â  Though unable to put my finger on this idea, I've experienced it a number of times when programming myself, and couldn't agree more.

The next chapter, "Classifying Prototype-based Programming Languages" sought to categorize the theoritical aspects of different prototypal languages.Â  This is the chapter where I most missed the reference to JavaScript, but I may look into doing that myself some other day.Â  "The Stripetalk Papers: Understandability as a Language Design Issue in Object-Oriented Programming Systems", made an argument that prototype based systems could be used to enhance the learnability of languages.Â  Finally, the chapter "Classes versus Prototypes in Object-Oriented Languages" looked at the advantages and disadvantages of class-based and prototype-based languages.Â  This chapter was quite interesting, however brief.

The second section, "Languages", lacking JavaScript, was less useful than I had hoped.Â  "Programming as an Experience: The Inspiration for Self" was interesting as it described the thought process going into creating the Self language, and expanded some of the ideas presented in the book's second chapter.Â  Alas, I've haven't yet gotten around to learning Self, but the ideas and history presented were interesting in the abstract.Â  "NewtonScript: Prototypes on the Palm" was interesting mostly because of it's Lisp-like syntax and it's description of internal closures, while "The Prototype-Instance Object Systems in Amulet and Garnet" took an in-depth look at the implementation of these two languages.Â  I only skimmed the "Omega: Statically Typed Prototypes" chapter, as it was rather brief, and I don't feel confident enough (or have any real desire) to enter the static-typed/dynamic-typed languages argument.

The final section, "Applications", was where this book showed it's age.Â  "Self includes: Smalltalk" involved translating Smalltalk programs into Self, which is interesting, but I don't see much practical application for this today (maybe if you're translating Ruby to JavaScript? Not sure).Â  "Using Prototypes for Program Restructuring" demonstrated the use of an algorithm that would help to restructure code into a slot-based prototype system in a application called Guru.Â  "Prototype-Based Programming for Abstract Program Visualisation" ended up being skimmed, because while the topic matter seemed interesting, the demonstrations from the black-and-white mac era looked totally antiquated, and I am sure that they have been written many times in other languages since the writing.Â  Finally, "Agora: The Scheme of Object-Orientation, or, the Simplest MOP in the World" detailed the Agora language, a pure OO language which relied only on objects and message passing, while being implemented as a reflective language inspired by Scheme, of all things. Weird, but interesting.

You know as well as I do that computer technology is a moving target, and something published in 1999 will be outdated to a certain degree.Â  The good part of this book is that the abstract notions in it are rather timeless, as they have been built on over time.Â  Parts of this book may be out of date, but parts aren't, and regardless, it's an interesting read.Â  I recommend it, if you're even slightly interested.]]></Content>

I've been exceptionally busy at work, we're beginning to finish up a much needed, <a href="http://www.library.drexel.edu/blogs/drexelbioscience/?tag=nih">much</a> <a href="http://laikaspoetnik.wordpress.com/2009/04/01/pubmed-changes-at-the-front-door/">discussed</a> by <a href="http://eagledawg.blogspot.com/2009/05/pubmed-update-now-online-now-share-your.html">librarians</a>, redesign of <a href="http://pubmed.gov">PubMed</a>.Â  We've put a ton of user interaction effort into this project, as well as a good sprinkling of graphic design (watch out, I even did some parts!)Â  I think people will be really positive about these new changes.

[Just for the record, if someone happens to stumble upon this from the librarian community, yes, release date is still end of summer, and yes, there will be a Beta period, so no need to worry about a short timeline to update your class or instructional slides.Â  We do listen!]

It's also been exciting that we've brought a few new people on board.Â  Always exciting to have new hires, despite the fact that it's a lot of work... and all of the trainings I have to do.

What else...Â  I'm planning on attending the <a href="http://delvenyc.com/">DelveUI masterclasses</a> this week in Brooklyn.Â  It will be interesting to see what some of the heads of state have to say about the field.Â  I'm a little excited, this masterclass format isn't the usual boring no-content fluff that you hear at most conferences. I get the feeling that there will actually be code present!Â  My thanks to the lovely <a href="http://www.sushiandrobots.com/">Jina "Sushi &amp; Robots" Bolton</a> for the opportunity for the free ticket.

I've been reading... way too many things.Â  I've been reading <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/learning-jquery-1.3/book">Learning jQuery 1.3</a>, <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/user-interface-library-for-jquery/book">jQuery UI 1.6</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1933988355?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eddwelsblo-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1933988355">jQuery in Action</a> and you'll see the reviews of those two books very soon.Â  (Can you tell that we've switched to jQuery at NCBI?)Â  I'm a little behind with that reading, but I've been working hard on other things.Â  Additionally, I went on an Amazon spree, and started reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596153813?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eddwelsblo-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0596153813">Programming the Semantic Web</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0954300653?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eddwelsblo-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0954300653">An Introduction to Lambda Calculi for Computer Scientists</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0192801422?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eddwelsblo-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0192801422">To Mock a Mockingbird</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0262062666?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eddwelsblo-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0262062666">101 Things I learned in Architecture School</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0735619670?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eddwelsblo-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0735619670">Code Complete 2</a>. Â  Last but not least, I've also been reading any photography book that I can get my hands on.

Yes, that is a lot of books, and I haven't had much time for them.Â  I've been working hard at work, and I want to relax a bit when I come home.Â  Once summer ends, things will return to a slightly more regular pace.Â  I've been learning so much on the job, that I'm not very worried about falling behind in reading.

It's the summer, so I have been riding... not a ton, but some.Â  I wish I had time to do more, but I don't have time for everything.Â  I have been taking long-ish 7 mile rides home, and then going out to play some basketball with my roommates.Â  That's a good time.Â  As soon as I finish this post, I am going to go and fix my fixie... <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ed_welker/499906278/">my favorite Bianchi</a>... I somehow mashed the pedals hard enough to shear off part of the thread of both the crank and the pedal, so there go the original cranks and some lovely <a href="http://sheldonbrown.com/harris/pedals.html#platform">MKS Sylvan Track Pedals</a> that were on there. I've got a new, generic replacement crankset and new Sylvan's.Â  Also, I'm moving from a 42x15 to a 46x17, but with the change in crank length (172.5 down to 165mm) I'll have the same gear ratio as before.Â  I'm interested in seeing how the shorter cranks feel.

Not to mention <a href="http://www.letour.fr/us/homepage_horscourseTDF.html">le Tour</a> this year... I was captivated.

<a title="Fish by eddie.welker, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ed_welker/3686013626/"><img class="alignright" style="border: 0pt none; margin: 1em 0em 1em 1em;" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2670/3686013626_b14883b58f_m.jpg" alt="Fish" width="160" height="240" /></a>And then <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ed_welker/">I've been taking some photos</a>.Â  Still have been good on my New Year's resolution of taking a photo every day... with the exception of Jan 20 (yes, Inauguration Day, the day more people in my Washington DC area took photos than any other this year).

I also got an iPhone.Â  While <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ed_welker/sets/72157620701884345/">I was in California</a> for <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ed_welker/sets/72157620771003449/">Joel and Olga's wedding</a>, I dropped my phone of more than 5 years on a rug, and the antenna that had been barely holding on for a few months finally fell off completely.Â  I had previously told myself that I would try to wait until my phone broke before getting a new one. So I was going to buy one at the first sight of antenna problems, until it was suggested that I wait for a new version.Â  Well, my phone's demise and the new version's release coincided, so now I have a 3GS.Â  Really the thing I like most is having my calendar with me at all times.Â  The only other part I really like is the speaker, so I can listen to music while on my bike for the first time.

Alright, so that's about that for the moment. Go out and do something summer-y, that's what I'm doing.]]></Content>

		<Title>Bad chain tool, bad</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[Finally got the cranks on, the pedals on, the new 17 tooth cog on the old wheel that I re-tensioned and trued (well, partially trued at least), only to put the chain on with a broken chain tool. (I didn't realize it was broken).  So one of the bushings became bent, and on my ride home, I popped the chain.  Tried to use alternate links to fix it, but they stuck (and ended up with only slightly bent bushings).  So a new chain it is for me, unfortunately.]]></Content>

		<Content><![CDATA[Summer was ending so I decided to move.Â  Ok, not really, it was simply time.

I've moved back to my parent's house in Laurel, MD... which is exceptionally close to Columbia, MD.Â  I've moved into my parents house in an attempt to save some money, I want to clean it and restore it, while putting my would-be rent money into the property taxes here.

The move wasn't difficult in and of itself, but tied with the work that needed (and still needs) to be done at the house, it has been quite an undertaking.Â  I have so much to do it's quite overwhelming.

All of that mess aside, I am looking forward to getting back to study.]]></Content>

		<Title>Review of Learning jQuery 1.3</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.packtpub.com/learning-jquery-1.3/book"><img class="size-full  alignleft" style="border: 0pt none; margin-right: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-top: 5px;" title="Learning jQuery 1.3" src="http://www.eddiewelker.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/learningjQuery.jpg" alt="Learning jQuery 1.3 Cover" width="225" height="278" /></a>There were many things to like about this book <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/learning-jquery-1.3/book">Learning jQuery 1.3</a> by Jonathan Chaffer and <a href="http://www.karlswedberg.com/">Karl Swedberg</a>.  The stand-out positive in my mind is the wealth of topics covered.  Both simple and difficult concepts are included, and both are handled with ease.  Good coding habits are repeatedly mentioned throughout.  Subjects like progressive enhancement are encouraged, and pitfalls like memory leaks are warned against.  Many real-world examples are included, as well as the full source code.

Learning jQuery 1.3 has a writing style that is very dry for a book written in a semi-conversational voice.  I prefer a writing style with a little more personality to it, but acknowledge that's not for everyone.

I did have two small complaints.  First, I like to see the API list out at the top of the chapters.  Appendix D contains a complete reference, but I like having a list of methods to be covered at the beginning of the chapter.  While I'm at it, I may mention that the "complete" reference is little more than a cheetsheet style list. Perhaps a little more would have been useful.

My second complaint is about the poor code syntax highlighting.  Just for record, this has nothing to do with the content, it's just a complaint against the publisher.  Take page 145, where three-quarters of the page is example code, but contains only bold line at the top showing the emphasized line.  First, the bold often wasn't enough to draw the eye... especially at the beginning of the book when a novice reader has to mentally separate standard JavaScript from jQuery code.  Second, I understand that the example code is included, but couldn't it have simply been excerpted here? I don't understand wasting an entire page, when much less would do.

Based on the overall quality of the book, I recommend it for jQuery beginners.]]></Content>

		<Title>Installing PIL inside virtualenv for Ubuntu 9.10</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[I just removed a (real live) bat from my living room.Â  That was easier than installing PIL in a virtualenv for Ubuntu 9.10. Why?Â  Googling the subject seems to bring up a lot of old or mis-information.Â  This will explain how... mostly so I can do it again next time.

I started with a --no-site-packages virtualenv, so as not to use (or moreÂ  importantly depend) on any of the global site-packages.Â  Ok, cool.

<code>$ virtualenv --no-site-packages myEnv</code>

First, I needed to install the python developer tools. (Use apt-get or aptitude, whatever floats your boat)

<code>$ sudo aptitude install python-dev</code>

Then, I needed to install libjpeg and libjpeg-dev.Â  I'm not sure why, but I needed libjpeg simply doesn't exist, so I needed to install libjpeg62.Â  I can't pretend that I know the difference (or if there is one).Â  In fact, I may have gotten away with installing libjpeg62 and libjpeg-dev (rather than both "62" versions... libjpeg62 and libjpeg62-dev), but only further testing will tell.

Why? If you install PIL without this library, you'll get those wonderful "decoder jpeg not available" messages in Python.Â  Or worse yet, if you're trying to use it in a Django, you may get some errors (specifically the "Upload a valid image. The file you uploaded was either not an image or a corrupted image" warning), or you may not get any until you open the shell.Â  Either way, you can test with the method listed below.Â  If you get the "decoder jpeg not available" message, your install didn't work.

The zlib package handles PNGs.

<code>$ sudo aptitude install libjpeg62 libjpeg62-dev
$ sudo aptitude install zlib1g-dev
$ sudo aptitude install libfreetype6 libfreetype6-dev</code>

Alright, now we seem to be done with the prerequisites. Start your virtualenv (of course, myEnv in the example is the name of your virtualenv).

<code>$ source myEnv/bin/activate</code>

Download PIL and install.Â  This will make sure to install PIL within your virtualenv's site-packages.

<code>(myEnv)$ wget http://effbot.org/downloads/Imaging-1.1.7.tar.gz
(myEnv)$ tar zxvf Imaging-1.1.7.tar.gz
(myEnv)$ cd Imaging-1.1.7
(myEnv)$ python setup.py install</code>

If you run into further problems (the "decoder jpeg not available" message again), you may have to resort to the <a href="http://effbot.org/zone/pil-decoder-jpeg-not-available.htm" target="_self">long directions</a> to get PIL and libjpeg to play happily together, but I hope not.

Now that you have everything installed, test it.Â  Open up a python shell from within your virtualenv.

<code>(myEnv)$ python</code>

Now try the following (with an image in your home directory) to see if everything is running smoothly.

<code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from PIL import Image
&gt;&gt;&gt; i = Image.open('/home/username/someJpeg.jpg')
&gt;&gt;&gt; i.save('/home/username/someOtherJpeg.jpg')</code>

If all of that works, you should now be ready to work.

Note: I would love to install the jpeg, freetype and zlib packages locally as well, but that was a step beyond what I was willing to mess with.Â  Maybe for a future set of instructions.

&nbsp;

****

UPDATE:

In Ubuntu 11, it seems that you need libjpeg8-dev, rather than libjpeg62.]]></Content>

		<Title>High Performance CSS code design</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[In the last few years much emphasis has been placed on web performance issues.  Browser vendors have optimized JavaScript engines, JavaScript libraries have been honed, and content delivery has been improved.  Unfortunately, CSS has received less attention.  Developers have been advised how to optimally transfer CSS files, and instructed to use CSS shorthand, but very little has targeted CSS code itself.

<a href="http://www.stubbornella.org/">Ms. Nicole Sullivan</a> is among those looking to improve CSS code.  She has been promoting "<a href="https://github.com/stubbornella/oocss">OOCSS</a>," or "<a href="https://github.com/stubbornella/oocss">Object Oriented CSS</a>," her methodology for how to design and refactor CSS<sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup>.   She has collected a number of best practices for architecting a CSS framework.   The benefits are simple: CSS will perform better, become more modular, as well as being grounded with a consistent API, making it easier to learn and use.  This is accomplished by reducing the file size and complexity of our CSS.

While many of these techniques can be considered common practice for experienced CSS programmers, implementing them can be difficult.  The art is in analyzing trade-offs and picking the optimal path.  That said, these rules are not for everyone, or every site.  It all boils down to deciding if the site's performance gain is greater than the time it takes to learn and use the techniques.
<h3>Useful for sites with</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Many pages</li>
	<li>A common visual and structural design</li>
	<li>Critical performance requirements</li>
</ul>
<h3>Less useful for sites with</h3>
<ul>
	<li>A few pages or just one page</li>
	<li>Varying design (possibly "portfolio" or design sites)</li>
	<li>Few performance concerns</li>
</ul>
So how do we get started?  We go hunting for bad code smells.  In Chapter 3 of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Refactoring-Improving-Design-Existing-Code/dp/0201485672"><em>Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code</em></a>, <a href="http://martinfowler.com/">Martin Fowler</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/kentbeck">Kent Beck</a> coin the phrase "code smell," meaning "structures in the code that suggest the possibility of refactoring."  Simply put, we go looking for chunks of code that our intuition tells us could be cleaned.  In the chapter heading, Grandma Beck is quoted (then talking about child-rearing), "If it stinks, change it."  We'll take a more formal approach to finding these code smells, going from easy to difficult.   First, we'll sniff around the CSS selectors, and then move onto the CSS properties.  Finally we'll look for visual design patterns that can direct the structure of our CSS.
<h2>Selectors</h2>
Selectors are both the easiest place to find code smells in CSS and the easiest to correct.  Three big code smells tend to stink up CSS selectors; unused selectors, location-based selectors, and overly specific selectors.  Each contributes significantly to increased CSS file size.
<h3>Unused Selectors</h3>
Code that does nothing is obviously wasteful, and is the first candidate for removal.  Tools like dust me selectors that can spider a site can identify all of the unused or orphaned styles that your stylesheets still contain.
<h3>Location-based Selectors</h3>
Location-based selectors prohibit code reuse because they are intended to isolate styles for a specific part of the page, yet frequently used HTML components are often reused in a different context.  Therefore, its counterproductive to hard-code that initial context into a selector.

Location-based selectors are easy to spot.  The pattern is a long list of selectors that starts with the same initial selector, as follows (assuming the source is reasonably ordered).

<code>.sidebar {â€¦}
.sidebar .nav {â€¦}
.sidebar .nav .box {â€¦}
.sidebar .nav .box .header {â€¦}
.sidebar .nav .box .body p {â€¦}</code>

Because each selector chain starts with a location-based selector, none of them are reusable.  What if we add a new group of pages that use the same .box structure but need to be placed in the content, header, or footer?  A novice would add more comma separated selector chains, but that amounts to copying code.
<code>
.sidebar .nav .box, .content .nav .box, .header .nav .box, .footer .nav .box {â€¦}</code>

The correct approach is to factor out the common functionality while ditching the location-based rules.  Now the styles can be reused regardless of the box location.

<code>.box {â€¦}
.box .header {â€¦}
.box .footer {â€¦}</code>

Why not break the .box and .header/.footer chains apart?   Here the .box class encapsulates the .header and .footer behaviors, hiding these names from the global scope and allowing the "header" and "footer" classnames to be used elsewhere.

To those looking ahead to HTML5, you should already recognize how this pattern can be applied to section elements containing header and footer elements.
<h3>Varying specificity</h3>
By 2010, everyone should be aware that adding "style" attributes directly to HTML elements is a bad idea (and code smell).  What about everything else?

Selectors that contain properties set as <code>!important</code> should be avoided because their specificity makes them difficult to override.

Browser selector hacks like <code>* html {â€¦}</code> should be avoided because they tend to require redefinition of both the problem properties and all other properties, leading to duplicate code.  When hacks are needed, use property hacks like the star (IE7 and less) and underscore (IE6 and less) instead.

Because IDs can be used only once per-page, selectors containing IDs can typically only be used in a specific place on each page.  IDs are great when you need to grab something from the DOM in JavaScript, but avoid them in your CSS.

Element selectors should be used to provide element defaults, especially when redefining styles previously zeroed out by a reset stylesheet.  Using them for anything but defaults tends to yield repetitive CSS.

Keeping selector specificity as similar as possible makes it easy to use classes that only define differences.

HTML:

<code><div>Default (black) box</div></code>

<code><!--because the selectors are the same specificity, it's easy to add multiple classes -->
<div>Green box</div>
<div> Red box</div></code>

CSS:

<code>.box { padding:1em; color:black; border: 1px solid black; }</code>

<code> </code>

<code>/* simple selectors because the specificity is equal to the base ".box" object's selector */
.green_border { border: 2px solid green; }
.red_border { border: 2px solid red; }</code>
<h2>Properties</h2>
Properties appear in CSS more frequently than selectors, and as a result their quantity masks their code smells a bit.  However we can exploit their frequency to find repetitive code<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup>.
<h3>Margin: 0 and padding: 0</h3>
Resetting the margin and padding properties to zero is extremely common.  Using a reset stylesheet will help you do this everywhere in one place.  A reset will zero all margin and padding properties, leaving only the non-zero values left to set.  If you find that your CSS contains more instances setting the margin or padding to another value (for example, 1em), you can edit your reset or add a global rule setting this alternate default.

Before:

(my.css)

<code>.portlet {margin:0; padding:0; â€¦ }
.header {margin:0; padding:0; â€¦ }
.footer {margin:0; padding:0; â€¦}
</code>

After:

(Reset.css)

<code>div {margin:0; padding:0}</code>

(my.css)

<code>.portlet { â€¦ }
.header { â€¦ }
.footer { â€¦ }</code>
<h3>Float</h3>
Overuse of the float property is a code smell indicating repetition in placing items on a page.  Use of a grid structure will reduce duplication caused by object placement.  Rather than have each element float itself, a grid structure will do this all one time only.
<h3>Font-size</h3>
It's rare for sites to use multiple sizes of body text on one page, or site wide.  Therefore most font-size properties are likely used to define header-like text sizes.   <a href="http://www.stubbornella.org/content/2010/07/01/top-5-mistakes-of-massive-css/" target="_self">Ms. Sullivan does an excellent job pointing out</a>, that of a finite number of font-sizes that can be used on a page, there are even fewer that a user can differentiate (for example the difference between 15px and 16px browser font sizes).  Font-size therefore is usually a code smell for repeating headers.
<h3>Mingling box model, visual formatting model, and presentational properties</h3>
The CSS specification groups similar properties into sections.  The Box model is the most famous (because it had previously been the most infamous).  Everyone is familiar with its margins, paddings, and borders building on widths and heights.  The Visual formatting model uses the display, position, float, clear, and z-index properties to dictate the layout of the boxes in the document.  The CSS specification makes no mention of "presentational properties," but that's a term I use to include color, background, font, and text properties that style the boxes or their contents.

Separating selectors along these lines allows for greater code reuse.  The box model properties are the most easily re-used of the three.  It is not uncommon for a number of boxes on the page to share the same properties, so moving these properties into a new class will allow you to apply these styles in a consistent and efficient manner.  The visual formatting properties are typically less likely to be reused, therefore separating them from the boxes will allow greater reuse of both the visual formatting and box properties.

It must be noted, however, that there will be cases where the same box model properties will often be paired with the same visual formatting properties. In that case it is perfectly acceptable to leave them coupled together.

Presentational properties are the least likely set to be reused. This isn't surprising because they are typically dependent on the contents of the boxes.  That makes these the most logical candidate for extraction, because doing so will increase the usability of the remaining properties.

Keep in mind we are still trying to build a consistent API for others to use.  Creating new patterns of box model, visual formatting model, and presentational property oriented classes will give future developers a wide range of flexibility to mix-and-match these classes while styling new elements.
<h2>Visual design patterns</h2>
In the last section, we looked at the effects of mingling box model, visual formatting model, and presentational properties.  Searching for visual design patterns is the next logical step, albeit a complicated one.

This technique is tricky.  Unlike the others, this has the additional restriction in that it is usually only suitable for finished designs.  Attempting this on an in-development design may send you on the road toward madness.  Additionally, it doesn't lend itself very well to searching code.  In effect we are looking for repeating groups of CSS propertiesâ€¦ but these properties can typically span multiple selectors!  So instead of looking to the code for patterns, we look for patterns in the other direction, at the visual output.

This technique also takes the longest, since it requires looking at all of the pages on a site as a whole.
<h3>Headers</h3>
Finding headers on the page should be fairly simple, and to be honest, you've probably taken care of this searching for repeated font-size properties as described above.  However a visual inventory may convince you that your headers are more alike than different, and you may find an opportunity to tighten the differences.  You may even decide to dump one of the variationsâ€”even better.
<h3>Portlets</h3>
In a portal or information dashboard oriented design, each chunk of output, whether contained in a box/window type structure, or structure-less (think Apple's Dashboard) is bound to share common characteristics. In the structure-less design you can focus on extracting the visual formatting properties into reusable classes defining position.  Box or window contained portlets can be constructed using a combination of box model, and presentational properties.  And if you're using a dashboard design, these chunks of output can probably be arranged using a grid structure.
<h3>Grids</h3>
Alignment is the key to identifying patterns where grids can be applied.  Take five steps back from your monitor and look at the top-level page objects.  If some of these objects are loosely aligned, they can probably be included into a grid.  Sketch the grid and the objects within on a piece of paper.  Now walk three steps forward, and look at the each individual section in your wireframe.  If you identify objects aligned in your sections, you may be primed for using a nested grid.  Sketch that grid (have you realized that you're wireframing yet?).  Keep going until you've exhausted all of the sections you've drawn (have you realized you're using recursion yet?)

Then start the tedious process of tearing out the previous code and replacing with a grid structure.. The end product will be far more efficient and easier to maintain.  (Which grid should you use? Which every you choose!  As long as you are using one your code will be cleaner and more efficient.)
<h3>"Media Blocks"</h3>
One pattern that Ms. Sullivan found frequently on the Facebook site is something she has coined a "Media Block," which <a href="http://www.stubbornella.org/content/2010/06/25/the-media-object-saves-hundreds-of-lines-of-code/">she defines</a> as "an image to the left, with descriptive content to the right."  Simply put, this is just a compound object, which is slightly more abstract than the previous examples.  She analyzes these media blocks in two steps.  First define their constant functional properties (what they do), then identify the variables in the design (parts could fluctuate in certain conditions).

Not all sites will contain objects like these, but if yours does, identifying the patterns will help to reduce code duplication and promote code reuse.
<h3>More</h3>
This short list couldn't hope to represent the entirety of the visual design patterns that can be found on a website.  That's why a site inventory is required.  If you find similar patterns repeating multiple times, this is a chance for you to optimize.
<h2>Results</h2>
Once these rules have been applied, your file size should be smaller, so less information has to be downloaded, making the page load faster.  The overall complexity of your CSS rules should also be reduced, meaning the browser will have less redundant rules to apply, and your page should load faster.  And finally, you will have defined an API for common CSS across your site, making it easier for developers to create new pages.
<hr />
<h2>Footnotes</h2>
<sup><a id="n1">1</a></sup> Personally, I find the choice of the "OOCSS" or "Object Oriented CSS" name both poor and misleading.  To call something "Object Oriented" when the metaphor doesn't fit (CSS has no data per se, and it certainly has no methods) is confusing, especially when the audience is likely to be familiar with the term.  To then give your CSS library the same name and overload the term twice obscures a very useful set of CSS refactoring methods.

<sup><a id="n2">2</a></sup> This can be accomplished with the Unix tool grep, a powerful text searching utility.  It is also possible to accomplish this through your editor, as long as it supports searching multiple files at once.  It is especially useful to be able to count occurrences across files.]]></Content>

		<Title>[Relatively] Quick pizza from scratch</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[<p>Tonight I tried a new recipe tonight, on a whim (I hit up the grocery store on the way home from work].  It was my first time making any pizza, much less two whole large pizzas, and they turned out extremely well. Â Only tools used were a food processor (with dough blade), oven, two pizza pans, and a pizza cutter. Â Adding the recipe here for my own records.</p>
<style>ol.recipe li{display:list-item;font-size:1.2em;margin-bottom:1em}</style>
<ol class="recipe">
	<li>Proof a teaspoon of yeast (dump it in 1/2 cup of warm water), let rest 10 minutes until one consistency.</li>
	<li>Add 3 cups of (bread, it's high-gluten) flour to food processor, 2 teaspoons (on the small side, unless you like salt), a teaspoon+ of freshly ground black pepper (optional), and pulse the food processor for a few seconds.</li>
	<li>Turn food processor on, add the 1/2 cup of water, and then get another 1/2 cup of water and add that. Â Add 2 tablespoons+ olive oil to the mix. Â Make sure the dough isn't sticky enough to stick to the sides, and not so dry that it's not sticky. Â If not, either add a teaspoon of flour or water (1 per 30 seconds) until it's the right consistency.  Adding too quickly means it won't work it's way through, and you may over-do it.</li>
	<li>Take dough, knead for a few seconds, put in a greased bowl, and let rise in warm area. Try for an hour or two, but 30 minutes (the time needed to get the other ingredients) is possible.</li>
	<li>Get all of the other ingredients together. Â Add slicing blade to food processor if possible. Â Gather all veggies, and slice them.</li>
	<li>Grab dough, pre-heat oven to 500 (or a little above.)</li>
	<li>Â (Very lightly) flour a countertop. Â Knead for a minute or two, then cut into two. Â Make two flat-ish, 5/6-inch (but still a little thick) pizza crusts. Â Let sit for 10 minutes (which makes it easier to shape), and then roll the dough into real pizza-crust sizes.</li>
	<li>Add olive oil on top of the dough. Â Then add tomato sauce, then add cheese.</li>
	<li>Add veggies. Â If sliced in the food processor, you can stack 'em high, and they'll simply bake down. Â Any thicker, and they may take a little longer. I used the 4mm slicer blade, and everything came out perfectly.</li>
	<li>Cook pizza for 10+ minutes, looking in @ 10 minutes. Â If you like, throw a 1/5th or less cup of water at the bottom, which [should] help the crust rise. Â If using a pizza stone, you can cook 2 @ the same time... one on the pizza stone which will cook faster, and one beneath. Â When the first is done, move the second up on the stone, and it will finish in just a few minutes.</li>
</ol>
<p>No, I did not make the sauce. Â Needed to save something for next time!!! Â Actually, next time I will let the dough rise in the fridge either from AM to PM, or overnight, though that may be overdoing it a bit. Â We'll see.</p>]]></Content>

		<Title>Onion-dill rice</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[Managed to concoct a recipe that I ended up quite liking today. Â Documented since I am unlikely to randomly repeat it. Â Makes 3-ish decently sized portions.

Start cooking 3/4 of a cup of rice.

Brown an onion in a tablespoon of olive oil, adding some salt (I used a medium amount [about 1/3 of a teaspoon] of coarse sea salt), and a decent amount of black pepper. Â Cook until moderately browned. Â (I added a teaspoon of A-1 sauce for a vinegar taste, and 1/4 of a tablespoon of hot thai seasoning [extremely spicy with a hint of lemon], but these are probably optional.)

Add 2 (or more... as much as you like) tablespoons of sliced garlic (not too thin), and 1 red pepper, cut into aprox. 1cm by 1cm cubes (you want a little flavor in each bite), and another tablespoon of olive oil. Â Cook until the peppers look good (the garlic will follow).

Add about 4-5 sprigs of fresh dill, ripping it into small pieces, and then the rice, and stir (feel free to add a tbsp or so of water if it's sticking). Â Cook for another 3-5 minutes, until the liquid is drained.

I served it with two tiny-tiny steaks cooked in the same large-sized pan, seasoned with salt and pepper, though the rice would have been enough split between two people.]]></Content>

		<Title>Wing contest at Quarry House</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[My first order of Quarry House wings was "medium."Â  The waitress had told me that they ran one level hot, and the medium were actually hotter than an standard "hot."Â  My nose was stuffed and my eyes were fully watered up at the end of twelve.

We decided to set up a trip with Andrew, Rich, myself, and my sister. I realized that Aman loves hot food too, so I invited him as well.Â  We formally decided to go the night that Young Frankenstein played at the <a href="http://afi.com/silver/">AFI</a>. The final group was myself, Simon, Andrew, Rich, Alissa, Cathy, Shveta, and Aman.

The order came out, 9 wings each of the mild, medium, hot, and 4 alarm.Â  As my sister said later, we probably should have started with the mild and worked our way up... but instead we each went to the 4 alarm. Lips started to burn, glasses (Rich's) came off, and instead of laughter, yelling, or anything positive, we all spent time making sure we were physically ok.Â  When the burning stopped, we could taste a familiar sweet habanero flavor.

Aman had three, Cathy and myself two each, and Andrew and Rich one.Â  Shveta took one bite and gave hers to Aman, while continuing to enjoy her Fin du Monde.Â  Cathy had her first Dogfish Head Palo Santo (and enjoyed it).

Young Frankenstein was amazing as usual.Â  Where wolf? There. There wolf.]]></Content>

bay leaves (the strongest you can find)
all spice berries
thyme (a lot of dried, since it's very water soluable, and doesn't last long when boiled)

potatoes (baby, about the size of a tablespoon)
onion (4+ big onions)
carrot (5+ medium carrots)
celery (3+ small stalks, not too much)
cabbage (a small one... it'll have to be cooked after taking some veggies/broth out, so it can't be too large.)

1) put the corned beef in, and add ~2 tsp mustard seed, 1.5 tsp peppercorn mix, 4 cloves, 8 juniper berries, 6 all spice berries, 2 very strong bay leaves or 4+ weak bay leaves), and 2 tablespoons of thyme or maybe a little more).

2) Cook for 2.5 hours, turning every half-hour.

3) After 2.5 hours, take out the corned beef, and add half the potatoes, carrots, and onion.Â  Cook for 15-25 minutes.

4) After those 15-25 minutes, add the rest of the veggies, and cook for another 15 minutes.

5) Take out half, and fill the empty space with the cabbage.Â  Cook on high for another 15 minutes.

6) Serve an 8th of cabbage, 2 slices of corned beef, a bowl-full of veggies, and add chopped fresh parsley on top.Â Â  Serve along with the Irish soda bread.

Irish soda bread

2 cups all purpose flour
2 cups whole wheat flour
1 tablespoon (or less) of baking soda

		<Title>Django, ALLOWED_HOSTS, Host header, Proxying, and more!</Title>
		<Content><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> tries to avoid CSRF, and thus requires a <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/topics/security/#host-header-validation">HTTP Host header be sent</a>. <a href="http://www8.org/w8-papers/5c-protocols/key/key.html#SECTION00070000000000000000">Host is optional in HTTP1.0</a>, so it therefore basically requires HTTP1.1. That Host header has to conform with <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1034.txt">RFC 1034</a> or <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1035.txt">RFC 1035</a>.

A proxy sitting in front of Django will pretty much do whatever you tell it to do, so it basically needs to convert HTTP1.0 requests into HTTP1.1 requests.Â  To do this in Nginx, you need to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15414810/whats-the-difference-of-host-and-http-host-in-nginx">know the difference between $host and $http_host, and have set $server_name</a>.

A HTTP1.0 request, as rare as it sounds, is possible, as tools like HAProxy send HTTP1.0 requests without Host headers. This implies that Amazon ELB or OpenStack Neutron health checks are all HTTP1.0 requests.]]></Content>
