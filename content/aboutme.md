Part programmer, cellist, biker, and photographer, I live in the suburbs of Maryland.Â Weee!Â I work at the [NCBI at NIH](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov "National Center for Biotechnology Information"), and pass the rest of the time reading, rooting for the Red Sox, and riding my bike.

I work in the… some group (the name keeps changing, and I’ve never gotten it straight) at the [National Center for Biotechnology Information](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) at the [National Institutes of Health](http://www.nih.gov/ "National Institues of Health") in [Bethesda, Maryland](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&time=&date=&ttype=&q=Bethesda,+MD&ie=UTF8&z=12&iwloc=addr&om=0). What do I do? Well, I mainly do web programming, and yes, I work on [PubMed](http://pubmed.gov). A lot. My websites get about 3 million hits a day, and that makes me happy.Â I’ve previously worked in C++, Perl, Python, and Ruby. I am fascinated by graphic design, machine learning, typography, and math, what a combo. I’m a bookworm, and read all the books on these subjects (and more!) that I can get my hands on. I am also a programming language geek… I play with [Scheme](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)), [Eiffel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eiffel_%28programming_language%29), Lisp, and other languages I can learn from.

[![Me in front of the Lincoln Center fountain](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2399/2109275877_a5f83c80a0_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/ed_welker/2109275877/ "Me in front of the Lincoln Center fountain by eddie.welker, on Flickr")My side projects are many, and most are never seen by eyes other than my own. I like to toy around Django, Python, Javascript, and Scheme.

I’ve played the cello since fourth grade, and am principal cellist of the [Columbia Orchestra](http://columbiaorchestra.org "The Columbia Orchestra"). I love music (of almost all genres) and enjoy to listen/play/read about music history. My favorite cellist has always been Mstislav Rostropovich, and I am especially fond of 20th-century Russian composers like Prokofiev, Shostakovich, and Miaskovsky. I used to be a member of the University of Maryland and [Greater Baltimore Youth Orchestra](http://gbyo.com "Greater Baltimore Youth Orchestra")s.

I’m an avid [Red Sox](http://boston.com/redsox/ "Boston Red Sox") fan who grew up watching them during the summers I spent at my grandparents house. I’m told the only thing I say during games is "Come on Man-ny!”

My basement is filled with a fleet of 8 bicycles (currently), 4 fixed gears, 3 road, and one old mountain. I love riding, and go whenever I can, rain or shine, in the hot or extreme cold.

I’m a photo geek as well. My dad was a big Olympus fan, so I chose that brand to use all of the lenses that were around. I’m still relatively new to this, but try to get better with every picture I take. I now use a combination of an Olympus E-520, and my baby, my Nikon D700.

I’m using wordpress hopefully because it will make things easier for me, until I foolishly decide it’s time to break the cardinal sin, and develop my own blog from scratch.
