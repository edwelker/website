Managed to concoct a recipe that I ended up quite liking today. Â Documented since I am unlikely to randomly repeat it. Â Makes 3-ish decently sized portions.

Start cooking 3/4 of a cup of rice.

Brown an onion in a tablespoon of olive oil, adding some salt (I used a medium amount \[about 1/3 of a teaspoon\] of coarse sea salt), and a decent amount of black pepper. Â Cook until moderately browned. Â (I added a teaspoon of A-1 sauce for a vinegar taste, and 1/4 of a tablespoon of hot thai seasoning \[extremely spicy with a hint of lemon\], but these are probably optional.)

Add 2 (or more… as much as you like) tablespoons of sliced garlic (not too thin), and 1 red pepper, cut into aprox. 1cm by 1cm cubes (you want a little flavor in each bite), and another tablespoon of olive oil. Â Cook until the peppers look good (the garlic will follow).

Add about 4-5 sprigs of fresh dill, ripping it into small pieces, and then the rice, and stir (feel free to add a tbsp or so of water if it’s sticking). Â Cook for another 3-5 minutes, until the liquid is drained.

I served it with two tiny-tiny steaks cooked in the same large-sized pan, seasoned with salt and pepper, though the rice would have been enough split between two people.
