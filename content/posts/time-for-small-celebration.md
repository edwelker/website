Indeed, it is time for a small party... my last 2 to 3 months of work has gone live!

Go take a look and see what's wrong with your foot. ðŸ™‚ Also, make sure to check out my favorite PubMed article. I'll give you the id... just search for that. It's: 17328369.

Unfortunately, it isn't a complete overhaul... in fact, it's pretty minor. There are many things that I would like to improve that were "put-away" for later. The good thing is that it is a really big step, and based on today's meeting, it certainly isn't the last. I am excited about the things I can do to the next major release... if that is what I end up working on next.
