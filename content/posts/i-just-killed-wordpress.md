Well, that was kinda fun.  I was trying to create a post, and when after I edited a <pre>, something I did killed WordPress within Firefox on my MacBook.  So I went inside and tried it on my frankenmac, and Firefox died there... three times.  Odd.  So I turned on my trusty old PC, and it crashed Firefox there too!

Finally, I opened Opera for Windows and it brought up a post with all the categories and title set, but with an empty text box.  Guess I have to delete that post, and try again!  Boo!
