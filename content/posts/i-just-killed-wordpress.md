Well, that was kinda fun. Â I was trying to create a post, and when after I edited a <pre>, something I did killed WordPressÂ withinÂ Firefox on my MacBook. Â So I went inside and tried it on my frankenmac, and Firefox died there… three times. Â Odd. Â So I turned on my trusty old PC, and it crashed Firefox there too!

Finally,Â IÂ openedÂ OperaÂ forÂ WindowsÂ and it brought up a post with all the categories and title set, but with an empty text box. Â Guess I have to delete that post, and try again! Â Boo!
