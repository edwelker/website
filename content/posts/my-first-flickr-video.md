I'm pretty happy with Flickr's new video service... I took this video back at the beginning of Feb, and tried to upload it to YouTube, where it was promptly rejected for being in the wrong format. I didn't want to bother converting it, so I just forgot about it for a while. Flickr, on the otherhand, instantly uploaded and converted the file for me. All I had to do was pick the file. Since I've been ridiculously busy, I can't beat the convenience factor with a stick! So enjoy!
