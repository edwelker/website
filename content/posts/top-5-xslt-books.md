I love reading programming books, especially to learn a new programming language.Â Learning XSLT, I read a large number of books, as there are quite a few available.Â The quality of the XSLT books struck me as particularly all over the place, some were quite good while others weren't even worth the time to skim.Â So I'm throwing together a simple list of my current collection of XSLT references, which happened to be my favorites of the bunch.Â Â These books are all geared towards specific audiences... beginners, advanced, etc, so I included their audiences.

- **[XSLT -- Mastering XML Transformations](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596000537?ie=UTF8&tag=eddwelsblo-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0596000537), Doug Tidwell**  
  This is my favorite XSLT book.Â Mr. Tidwell did a great job of combining an introduction to the language, a tutorial on how to write XSLTs, and a reference all into one book.Â On top of that, I found it to be written in the clearest, most conversational style I've found in many a programming book.Â I find this book covers 90% of my day-to-day needs, and when I forget how something works, this book usually answers my questions.Â (Plus, hey, you can get the 1.0 version for about $3 used.)
- **[XSLT: Programmer's Reference](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470192747?ie=UTF8&tag=eddwelsblo-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0470192747), Michael Kay**  
  If Mr. Tidwell's book covers 90%, this book covers all 100%, and then some.Â Mr. Kay (who wrote the Saxon processor, if you weren't aware) presents what amounts to an annotated specification in book form.Â One of my co-workers calls this book the XSLT dictionary, and I can't argue with that.Â This book is probably best for advanced programmers.
- **[XSLT and XPATH on the Edge](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0764547763?ie=UTF8&tag=eddwelsblo-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0764547763), Jeni Tennison**  
  Once you've got the basics of the language down, you've got to use it to write real-world code.Â I found this book helps to smooth down the rough edges of working with the language.Â This book requires a mid-level familiarity with the language.
- **[XSLT Cookbook, Second Edition](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596009747?ie=UTF8&tag=eddwelsblo-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0596009747), Salvatore Mangano**  
  I reach for this book whenever I've got to do something weird.Â I use it to find the solution to some odd edge case, or for my "can I do this with XSLT" questions.Â The book covers everything from faking regular expressions, to set operations on different node-sets, to functional programming with XSLT.Â I don't use it often, but it's like gold when I do.Â This book is mostly for advanced users.
- **[XPath and XPointer](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596002912?ie=UTF8&tag=eddwelsblo-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0596002912), John E. Simpson**  
  The content in this book is totally covered in each of the other books, and it isn't really XSLT, because it only covers XPath.Â But this book is my simple reference to 90% of the XPath questions I have.Â It is a nice little book that I could live without, but it certainly makes my life easier having it around.Â I think new users will likely get the most out of this book. (Another book that can be had for about $3 used.)

(For disclosure, I did make the links amazon referrals. I feel kinda weird, but figured why not. I don't expect any results, but if I got some, it'd go straight to buying a new book.)
