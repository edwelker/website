In a move totally unlike me, I agreed to rent a house today, and on first look. Just over a mile from work, multiple rooms (one of which I am going to have to rent), it looks like I am moving to [Kensington, MD](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=10109+Crestwood+rd,+kensington+,+Md+20895&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=33.626896,67.236328&ie=UTF8&ll=39.021851,-77.093189&spn=0.008052,0.016415&z=16&om=1). Not the greatest place, but could I afford to look for something else?Ã‚ Especially time-wise? It was expensive... but not compared to other places in the area. $$$ flying everywhere.

Woah.
