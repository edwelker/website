[![](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2327/2344026927_f9d790229f_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/people/ed_welker)My new resolution: learn how to take better photographs, simply to reduce the time I spend editing them!

I’ve decided that once I do that, I will retire my Olympus C-8080, and move on to a Digital SLR. Reviews are mixed (at best) about the E-3, and I may like something better than the E-510. Anyway, I’m getting ahead of myself... use the camera I have first!
