Last weekend, I FINALLY had a chance to clean my room, and I’m pleased with the results.Â Really, though, this post is just an excuse to do one of those "this is my desk, this is my bookshelf" posts that everyone seems to do.Â 🙂

My favorite books are mostly at the top (actually, there’s no rhyme or reason to any of it).Â Just looking, I realize that there are a bunch of Ruby books that I almost never look at. The orange book behind the wire on the top shelf is a really good [Dover book on Graph Theory](http://www.amazon.com/Introductory-Graph-Theory-Gary-Chartrand/dp/0486247759/).

[![My Desk](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3047/2679182862_8e2a225be4.jpg "My Desk")](http://www.flickr.com/photos/ed_welker/2679182862/ "My Desk by eddie.welker, on Flickr")

My monitor setup.Â I’ve got 3 computers, the laptop, my ‘frankenmac’ desktop, and a pc.Â The frankenmac is dying, so I am probably going to have to shift things around.Â I don’t have a plan for which computer will go with which monitor, but the desk is now set, and won’t change.Â I’ve got my new [Griffin Elevator](http://www.griffintechnology.com/products/elevator) sitting there.Â I’m happy with it, keeps the bottom of the laptop really cool.

Anyway, it’s been a week... let’s see how clean I can keep it.
