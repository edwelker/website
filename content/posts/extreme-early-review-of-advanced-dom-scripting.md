Started reading through [Advanced DOM Scripting](http://advanceddomscripting.com/2007/07/19/the-smell-of-fresh-ink/) by Jeffrey Sambells. Normally would wait to comment until I got to the end, but I am excited that he mentioned both the scope chain and closures in the first chapter! As my sister would say, “Sweet Lovin!”
