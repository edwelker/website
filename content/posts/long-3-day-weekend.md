So I return from East Hampton.Â 800 miles to empty out the freezer (and then de-ice it with only a metal spatula).Â Â Alright, so I’ve had some better trips.Â At least the [Amagansett Farmer’s Market](http://flickr.com/photos/ed_welker/499972493/) was good.Â And the surf looked good (if not near-frozen). I won’t go into details, but my weekend consisted of:

- 800 Miles of driving.Â That’s a lot.Â Additionally, I got stuck in one traffic jam on the L.I.E., but made my orchestra rehearsal... by three minutes.
- Cleaning out the fridge, bringing in the latter, insulating the skylight, closing windows, bringing in tools, and all of the other things we do to "close down" the house.Â Not sure why I did it all myself.
- Cutting the large fallen branch of a red-pine tree.Â It was so large that I had to cut it with my small handsaw... so I could simply drag it across the yard.
- Finding out my favorite pizza place of the last 20 years is now owned by someone else.Â Instead of Yankees photos on the wall (even I can admit it’s appropriate for a NY pizza joint), the woman who ran my credit card was wearing a VA Tech sweatshirt.Â That’s simply wrong.Â Boo, Springs Pizza, boo.
- I gave the chinese place a second chance... turned out to be the worst chinese I’ve ever had.Â Heh, and the place was called "Best Taste," of all things.

Now that I am back, my list of tasks continues.Â Bills are due soon, room looks like a tornado hit it, still trying to rent the basement, want to get Xmas shopping done early.Â Groan.

I promise to edit the photos soon too... I’ve got about 5,000 on backlog.Â Groan-again.
