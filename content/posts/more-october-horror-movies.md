Continuing the reviews of my house’s October horror movie film-fest:

- [28 Days Later](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0289043/) – Rick told me that this was among the most realistic zombie movies ever made.Â While it had a realistic look and feel, I had a problem with the unrealistic (and porous) plot line.Â Of the 4 or so main characters, the supporting father and daughter roles were sympathetic, but I cared nothing for the main male and female leads.Â That would be fine, if I didn’t also have to care about the weak plot (and yes, I know we’re talking about a zombie movie, but still!).Â I didn’t dislike the movie, but it wasn’t my favorite.
- [Hellraiser](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093177/) – I’ve been excited about watching this ever since I first heard [the (rejected) soundtrack by Coil](http://www.brainwashed.com/common/htdocs/discog/coil1.html).Â It was well worth it.Â The movie’s imagery was pure 80’s (a compliment) and quite realistic, compared to the only-special-effects imagery I’m used to after watching modern movies. I won’t soon forget the rats nailed to the walls.Â Hoping I can sneak Hellraiser II in before Halloween.
- [The Shining](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081505/) – I’m sure I don’t need to mention how this movie helps to define the horror genre.Â It’s spooky, creepy, and maintains the feeling that things are about to descend into total chaos for so long that you’re exhausted by the end.Â My only problem is that the Simpson’s parody is so good that’s all I could think of at times.Â Teriffic movie.
- [Feast](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0426459/) – Ok, I didn’t get all the way through this last night, but I’ve seen it (a few times) before.Â It doesn’t take itself too seriously, and is a quintessential example of a trashy, gorey, funny horror movie.Â You’d think the end woud be a let-down after how front-heavy the action is, but you’d be wrong.
