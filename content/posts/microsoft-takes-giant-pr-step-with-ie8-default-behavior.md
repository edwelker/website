So[ Microsoft announced they’re changing the default rendering behavior in IE8](http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2008/03/03/microsoft-s-interoperability-principles-and-ie8.aspx).Â Reasons why aside ([see 3rd to last paragraph](http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2008/mar08/03-03WebStandards.mspx)), they are actually doing it.Â This simply spreads good will, which is something Microsoft is hardly known for.Â It’s a big public relations boon.

Seriously, thank you Microsoft.Â Here’s to the continued spreading of good will.
