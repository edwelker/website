[![Outside Fenway Park](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2052/2037125504_838bd18b89_m.jpg "Outside Fenway Park")](http://flickr.com/photos/ed_welker/sets/72157603199931598/)Some part of me, deep down, will not let me post photos without cracking open Photoshop first. I don't know why I feel so strongly about it, but my gut won't let me avoid it. So of course, it's ages before I feel alright showing anyone what I took.

Be that as it may, I've been focused the last 2 days, buring through many of them. I've got two sets down, with one remaining. I've posted the first two to my newly purchased flickr pro account (I ran over the 200 image limit, and want to continue to see the old ones.)[![ashes of kings](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2124/2034253840_d914f88ea1_m.jpg "ashes of kings")](http://flickr.com/photos/ed_welker/sets/72157603191451734/)

Check out my [party/band shots](http://flickr.com/photos/ed_welker/sets/72157603191451734/), and my photos of [Boston and ALCS game 2](http://flickr.com/photos/ed_welker/sets/72157603199931598/).
