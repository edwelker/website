[Microsoft is claiming that a working version of IE8 is showing the smiley](http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2007/12/19/internet-explorer-8-and-acid2-a-milestone.aspx), and has passed [the Acid2 test](http://www.webstandards.org/action/acid2/). Even if Microsoft is lying, this means that at the very least, someone there is using a browser that can pass!
