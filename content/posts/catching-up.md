This is my appropriately named "catching up" post. As most know, I've moved over the last month. Despite my early action, I still had to do a lot of work at the end of the month. C'est la vie, that's what moving is. Aside that, I've also been focused on various work related things (css, xslt, and the "portal" system), as well as the end of baseball's regular season and the beginning of the post season.

On my list of things to touch in full... 1) Advanced DOM Scripting. I finished the book (a while ago) but haven't had a chance to review it yet. At the risk of ruining the surprise for my one (hopefully) reader, it was teriffic, and I highly recommend it.  I will do a full write-up later. 2) My comments on The Little Schemer. This is simply an amazing book that's opened up a number of paths in my brain. I'm afraid that any review wouldn't do it justice. Maybe some thoughts on the book everyone should read. 3) Random thoughts on Bethesda, Kensington, Rockville (my new home!), riding my bike again, the Tchaikovsky concert coming up, my xslt class coming up, my recent css exploits... as you can see, I've got a lot of things that I am thinking about, but nothing to put down on paper... yet. (Yes, I know, really, there is no paper... shut up!)

Contrast that with the time that I MUST spend with friends, and the potential Boston trip coming up... and I've got a lot to do!! Better get started. Washing my clothes now...
