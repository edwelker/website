My roommates and I have decided to try to watch a horror/thriller every night of October.Â Unfortunately, the Red Sox and a few other distractions have prevented watching one *every* night, but here's what we've got so far:

- [Nightwatch](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119791/) – Not a fan of this movie.Â I thought that the scary parts were kinda cheap, and that the plot of the movie was gross (really gross) for the sake of being gross.Â That gets under my skin faster than just about anything.Â Plus, what's the point of a movie where the number of possible suspects is 2? As Rick points out, one of the biggest hit/miss parts of *Scream* was that there were 15 possible suspects. That's much more interesting.Â This was Alissa's pick.
- [Sisters](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070698/) – A psychological horror movie about two Siamese twins that were separated after a number of years and the emotional result of that operation. Very spooky, in a thought-required way.Â This movie was my pick.
- [Dressed to Kill](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080661/) – Continuing on the [Brian De Palma](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000361/) theme... I'm a sucker for Michael Caine.Â So I really enjoyed his performance.Â The rest of the movie had a really constant quality to it that wasn't quite eerie, but was close.Â Unfortunately, I fell asleep during part of the film (not long...) but I liked it anyway.Â This was Rick's choice.

And upon consultation with them (I had to ask just to be certain) that was it.Â They watched [Cape Fear](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101540/) without me (I've seen it before), but even still... 4 movies in 16 days isn't good enough.

Other movies that I remember are on our combined list:

- Alien
- The Shining
- Feast\*
- Carrie\*
- Hellraiser I &amp; II
- [Repulsion](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059646/)\* (one of the scariest I've ever seen, and one of my favs)
