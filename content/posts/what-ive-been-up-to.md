Though I doubt it will mean anything to anyone... I threw this diagram together Monday night. It's [](/myncbiwireframesv1.pdf "NCBI Application design")[my application design](/ncbibaseapp_designv1.pdf "my application design") for a default NCBI application. I'm pretty excited about it. Not too fancy, but a nice start.

I've also been thinking about writing a Firefox extension. It's about time that I play around with it, and I was thinking that a pretty simple app (like [twitbin](http://www.twitbin.com/)) would be a good place to start. No plans yet, but... ideas.

Speaking of ideas, when is [twitter](http://twitter.com) going to become open source and (then) de-centralized? That would be awesome...

Alright, now time to take the design and make it generic... woo hoo overloading!
