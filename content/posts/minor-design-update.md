So I tweaked the CSS and arrived at this. I kinda like it. It reminds me of a pair of eighties boating shorts, not quite sure why. It isn't the most pleasing design, but that is intentional. Clean wasn't the goal, I was aiming for something more... me. Well, enough me as CSS can produce. (I think I just said I'm like CSS boating shorts...weird) I'm a strong believer that all comps should be done in Photoshop, where you have a freedom that CSS doesn't allow. Then you take the comp and cut it up using good CSS and HTML. I didn't do any of that. This was just a tweak, and a tweak on a whim at that.

Anyway, I will try to start a more formal "design" soon, but not likely before I start moving.
