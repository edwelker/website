So I got the domain, I got the hosting, and I have the blog. I just need a few hours (ha!) to design the site, and put the blog in it. Yea...

For the moment, I've decided to go with this theme... I like the yellow, and its fairly simple. Simple is good. I don't like the long lines of text, but if you want something done right, gotta do it yourself.

More later!
