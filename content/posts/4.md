Upon seeing a few different write-ups in the last few days (that I stumbled upon without searching for), I think that I'm going to \[already\] change this blog software to [ExpressionEngine](http://expressionengine.com/), which I hear is the most customizable tool out there. It's not that I am planning on doing crazy design things here, but I would like the chance. We'll see what the programmer in me says when I see it.

I did find a tool called [Symphony](http://21degrees.com.au/) that sounds rather interesting, and it uses XSLTs for the backend (somehow). Since I have been learning XSLTs at work, I am probably going to give that a look as well. Plus I like the musical reference.

Was going to do this yesterday, but my sister got her hands on free Nationals tickets. Boring game until the 8th, when they hit 2 HRs (Dimitri Young was one!), but then stupid Kerns got caught off second on a fly ball to right. Way to go.
