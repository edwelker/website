[![Photo by Vidiot. Click image for details.](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3079/2636931241_f5f3e3d390_m.jpg "Photo by Vidiot. Click image for details.")](http://www.flickr.com/photos/vidiot/2636931241/)Happy July 4th!Â Now, with that out of the way...

My sister Tania was at the [Nathan's Hot Dog eating competition](http://www.nathansfamous.com/PageFetch/getpage.php?pgid=38) today.Â She was happy with the result, I was rooting for Kobayashi.Â Oh well.Â My roommate was rather disgusted by the whole thing.Â Me?Â I found myself *REALLY* wanting a hot dog.

Speaking of food... my roommate and I were flipping channels the other day and she insisted on stopping on the food network.Â They had a show on about local resturants known only to locals.Â The first part was on a place I've passed countless numbers of times, called [Chaps Charcoal Resturant](http://www.chapspitbeef.com/). It looked pretty good, and the prices are good, so I may have to visit soon.

Since I'm on a food kick at the moment, one more... this may also soon become [my favorite thing](http://bitten.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/07/01/my-new-favorite-thing/).Â Gotta try it.

Elsewhere...

The [Sox won, beating the Yankees today](http://www.boston.com/sports/baseball/redsox/articles/2008/07/04/lester_pitches_5_hitter_red_sox_end_5_game_skid/), but are still behind the Rays.Â If the Rays suffer injuries down the stretch, they'll fall.Â However, that seems to be a big if.Â The Red Sox need to get a number of people back.

AndÂ more locally...

When I have some free moments, I've been working rebuilding [gbyo.com](http://www.gbyo.com) in [Django](http://www.djangoproject.com/).Â The programming part isn't particularly hard (despite not being familiar with Python... though, it's not unlike other languages), and I kinda like the [database API](http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/db-api/) (It's been a while, so I only barely remember [ActiveRecord](http://wiki.rubyonrails.org/rails/pages/ActiveRecord), but I seem to like this more).Â The thing I haven't grasped yet is overall project structure.Â I'm working on that.

I've bought a [number](http://www.amazon.com/Iterating-Infusion-Clearer-Objects-Classes/dp/1590595378) of [books](http://www.amazon.com/Making-Web-Work-Designing-Applications/dp/0735711968) [recently](http://www.amazon.com/How-Solve-Heuristics-Zbigniew-Michalewicz/dp/3540660615), and hope to start reading them soon.Â Right now, I am reading [this](http://www.amazon.com/Learning-Website-Development-Technologies-Solutions/dp/1847193358), as [the publishers](http://www.packtpub.com/) were nice enough to send me a review copy.Â Review coming soon.Â Additionally, I want to post some [more formal thoughts](http://realtech.burningbird.net/learning-javascript/basics/javascript-the-good-parts) about Crockford's Javascript book soon. (Note: yes, that first linked book cost me .48 cents, w/o shipping)

I'm trying to convince people to go on vacation with me.Â So far, I haven't heard back from anyone.Â That will only stall me, it will not deter me.
