In an effort to keep my mind occupied elsewhere, here are a couple of distractions to share.

[The Magical Minimalism of Microformat](http://open.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/12/05/the-magical-minimalism-of-microformats/) -- The New York Times tipping their hat to Microformats

[Internet Explorer 8](http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2007/12/05/internet-explorer-8.aspx) -- Please don't be lying, please don't be lying, please don't be lying...

[Email Standards Project](http://www.email-standards.org/) -- Please turn out to be relevant

[Odiogo](http://odiogo.com/) -- Convert RSS feeds to podcasts. I rarely ever listen to podcasts \[ok, fine, I never listen to them\], but I still like the idea.
