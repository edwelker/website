Tonight I am packing for Boston.Â Red Sox ALCS game 2 is tomorrow evening, and I wouldn't miss it for the world.Â I was looking forward to visiting my friend Kacy, but I haven't been able to get in touch with her yet.Â Kristen, my other Boston cello-playing girl has been in touch, and we're probably going to hang out while I am up there.

Alas, because of my (stupid) XSLT class Monday morning, I have to leave on Sunday evening, so I don't really get to see much.Â This is upsetting, as I haven't been to Boston in YEARS.Â The part that makes it especially upsetting is that I still remember most of what I did the last time I was there.
