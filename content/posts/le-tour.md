I’ve been following [Le Tour](http://www.letour.fr/) again this year.Â Previously, the aerial shots of France kept my attention, but this year I have been interested in theÂ competition.Â I’ve found the mini-goals and side stories are as good as the goal of *le maillot jeune*.![Le Tour](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3286/2666603321_2c10b6c79c_m_d.jpg "Le Tour")

Anyway, I try to avoid re-posting the "hot link of the day" type linksâ€"the ones that have been passed around on other blogsâ€"but the Boston Globe’s [Big Picture blog](http://www.boston.com/bigpicture/2008/07/2008_tour_de_france.html) is worth it… just take a look at those photos.Â This [set from the flickr blog](http://blog.flickr.net/en/2008/07/16/tour-de-france-2/) is also pretty cool.

Still not enough? [Follow tour coverage](http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/t/tour_de_france_bicycle_race/index.html) from the New York Times.
