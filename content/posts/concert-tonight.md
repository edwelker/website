I've got a concert tongiht. [Check out the Columbia Orchestra site for details](http://columbiaorchestra.org/). Tchaikovsky 4, along with Strauss' first Horn Concerto, and a Brandenburg. Should be pretty good, especially since I've practiced a fair amount for this.

I don't expect anyone I know to come, as there is also something going on in Boston tonight. Some sort of baseball game?

So yea, come and see me torn. Don't expect me to hang around after the concert for any more than a second though.
