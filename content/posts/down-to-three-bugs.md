I'm officially (at this moment) down to three bugs on my project at work. This means... that I am almost ready to resume my life, as well as writing here... for the first time in 6 straight months. I'll be taking some (much needed) vacation time at some point, but am anxiously looking forward to re-connecting with this site.

Additionally, can I just mention that the Celtics won? So my Red Sox are World Series champs, my Giants are NFL champs, and now my Celtics are NBA champs. How sweet is that???
