My thought for the day is this:

Everyone should keep usability in mind while performing their job.<span> </span>While creating something (especially like a website), some aspects end up being unrelated-graphic<span> </span>design to programmers, implementation details to designers, etc-however usability should be an part of every aspect of the creation process.<span> </span>There are an unending number of uses to design for, the least we can do is succeed for one or two.<span></span>
