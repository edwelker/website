Not a technical post, but a personal update.Â I promised over a week ago. [![Air Me](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3494/3753939045_227dd6b275_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/ed_welker/3753939045/ "Air Me by eddie.welker, on Flickr")

I’ve been exceptionally busy at work, we’re beginning to finish up a much needed, [much](http://www.library.drexel.edu/blogs/drexelbioscience/?tag=nih) [discussed](http://laikaspoetnik.wordpress.com/2009/04/01/pubmed-changes-at-the-front-door/) by [librarians](http://eagledawg.blogspot.com/2009/05/pubmed-update-now-online-now-share-your.html), redesign of [PubMed](http://pubmed.gov).Â We’ve put a ton of user interaction effort into this project, as well as a good sprinkling of graphic design (watch out, I even did some parts!)Â I think people will be really positive about these new changes.

\[Just for the record, if someone happens to stumble upon this from the librarian community, yes, release date is still end of summer, and yes, there will be a Beta period, so no need to worry about a short timeline to update your class or instructional slides.Â We do listen!\]

It’s also been exciting that we’ve brought a few new people on board.Â Always exciting to have new hires, despite the fact that it’s a lot of work... and all of the trainings I have to do.

What else...Â I’m planning on attending the [DelveUI masterclasses](http://delvenyc.com/) this week in Brooklyn.Â It will be interesting to see what some of the heads of state have to say about the field.Â I’m a little excited, this masterclass format isn’t the usual boring no-content fluff that you hear at most conferences. I get the feeling that there will actually be code present!Â My thanks to the lovely [Jina "Sushi &amp; Robots" Bolton](http://www.sushiandrobots.com/) for the opportunity for the free ticket.

I’ve been reading... way too many things.Â I’ve been reading [Learning jQuery 1.3](http://www.packtpub.com/learning-jquery-1.3/book), [jQuery UI 1.6](http://www.packtpub.com/user-interface-library-for-jquery/book), and [jQuery in Action](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1933988355?ie=UTF8&tag=eddwelsblo-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1933988355) and you’ll see the reviews of those two books very soon.Â (Can you tell that we’ve switched to jQuery at NCBI?)Â I’m a little behind with that reading, but I’ve been working hard on other things.Â Additionally, I went on an Amazon spree, and started reading [Programming the Semantic Web](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596153813?ie=UTF8&tag=eddwelsblo-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0596153813), [An Introduction to Lambda Calculi for Computer Scientists](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0954300653?ie=UTF8&tag=eddwelsblo-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0954300653), [To Mock a Mockingbird](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0192801422?ie=UTF8&tag=eddwelsblo-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0192801422), [101 Things I learned in Architecture School](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0262062666?ie=UTF8&tag=eddwelsblo-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0262062666), [Code Complete 2](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0735619670?ie=UTF8&tag=eddwelsblo-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0735619670). Â Last but not least, I’ve also been reading any photography book that I can get my hands on.

Yes, that is a lot of books, and I haven’t had much time for them.Â I’ve been working hard at work, and I want to relax a bit when I come home.Â Once summer ends, things will return to a slightly more regular pace.Â I’ve been learning so much on the job, that I’m not very worried about falling behind in reading.

It’s the summer, so I have been riding... not a ton, but some.Â I wish I had time to do more, but I don’t have time for everything.Â I have been taking long-ish 7 mile rides home, and then going out to play some basketball with my roommates.Â That’s a good time.Â As soon as I finish this post, I am going to go and fix my fixie... [my favorite Bianchi](http://www.flickr.com/photos/ed_welker/499906278/)... I somehow mashed the pedals hard enough to shear off part of the thread of both the crank and the pedal, so there go the original cranks and some lovely [MKS Sylvan Track Pedals](http://sheldonbrown.com/harris/pedals.html#platform) that were on there. I’ve got a new, generic replacement crankset and new Sylvan’s.Â Also, I’m moving from a 42×15 to a 46×17, but with the change in crank length (172.5 down to 165mm) I’ll have the same gear ratio as before.Â I’m interested in seeing how the shorter cranks feel.

Not to mention [le Tour](http://www.letour.fr/us/homepage_horscourseTDF.html) this year... I was captivated.

[![Fish](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2670/3686013626_b14883b58f_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/ed_welker/3686013626/ "Fish by eddie.welker, on Flickr")And then [I’ve been taking some photos](http://www.flickr.com/photos/ed_welker/).Â Still have been good on my New Year’s resolution of taking a photo every day... with the exception of Jan 20 (yes, Inauguration Day, the day more people in my Washington DC area took photos than any other this year).

I also got an iPhone.Â While [I was in California](http://www.flickr.com/photos/ed_welker/sets/72157620701884345/) for [Joel and Olga’s wedding](http://www.flickr.com/photos/ed_welker/sets/72157620771003449/), I dropped my phone of more than 5 years on a rug, and the antenna that had been barely holding on for a few months finally fell off completely.Â I had previously told myself that I would try to wait until my phone broke before getting a new one. So I was going to buy one at the first sight of antenna problems, until it was suggested that I wait for a new version.Â Well, my phone’s demise and the new version’s release coincided, so now I have a 3GS.Â Really the thing I like most is having my calendar with me at all times.Â The only other part I really like is the speaker, so I can listen to music while on my bike for the first time.

Alright, so that’s about that for the moment. Go out and do something summer-y, that’s what I’m doing.
