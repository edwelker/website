I am trying hard to find a new place in Bethesda, but everything is so expensive... if only they would [start the purple line](http://www.innerpurpleline.org/), life would be much easier. I'd still be trying to move regardless, but life would be easier. Ideal location would be on 185 (Conn. Ave) near the beltway so I can jump right on to get to Monday night orchestra rehearsals, as well as riding my bike to work. We'll see.

I've been avoiding riding my bike to the metro and taking that, because I can reduce my commute time from 3 hours to 1 or less by driving. That, and oh yea... someone got shot recently on the path I took every day this past year. This is after the random stabbing. Not going to be going that way anytime soon.

I do need to get back out riding, however. I may have to start going elsewhere... or even driving to a spot to start. Thats a lot of effort... not sure I am up for that.
