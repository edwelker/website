I've been keeping an eye on the Red Sox game all night on my computer. When I saw David Ortiz up in the 9th with a man on, and down by 1 run, I went running into the living room and turned on the TV. He fouled off one pitch, and then, just in time for the arrival of fall, Papi hits a walk-off home run into the newly cooled air.
