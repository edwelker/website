The first time I played Yahtzee was... only about a month ago. I won 3 of my first 4 games. It was a fun game. I wonder how that game would be if I played against... oh, let’s say... Microsoft. Probably... not so much.

[Jeremy Keith](http://adactio.com/), my favorite famous-web-developer-that-I-watch-from-afar-via-his-blog (sorry, didn’t have a better term for that... he seems like a fun guy) has [written a follow up post about the IE8 doctype meta mess](http://adactio.com/journal/1403). As I’ve come to expect, he has eloquently suggested a rational and positive approach to the proposal. As I mentioned [in my last post](http://edwardwelker.com/2008/01/22/ie8-doctype-and-potentially-broken-default-behavior/), the meta isn’t really that terrible, while the default behavior ***is***. Jeremy, along with others, suggest we need to politely and intelligently urge Microsoft, hoping they re-consider. This of course, is the correct course of action. Insults, and things of that nature are just a waste... life’s too short.

The problem, is that life is short. The list of things that we’re waiting on from Microsoft is long. And there is very little crossed off! We’re still waiting on correct handling of CSS. We’re still waiting on correct javascript behavior. I worry that it will be forever before Microsoft takes it’s turn in this game.

I’m all for civil discourse. This IE8 hub-bub made me instantly think of an online petition. But while I will be cheering Microsoft on, excuse me if I keep my fingers crossed behind my back. Will Microsoft make the next move? Will they pause the game and get back to it? Hopefully. My father always told me that we had a relative who would pretend to sneeze while kicking the checker board. That wouldn’t be nice, but it would be swift. A game ended by neglect may be far more painful.
