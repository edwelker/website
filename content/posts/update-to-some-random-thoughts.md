1\) I took a look at the book on [Processing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processing_(programming_language)), and it does look quite nice. That being said, I'm not quite sure what I'd use it for. So it fell a bit on my list.

2\) Letterman is still pretty much the same. I haven't seen Leno. Jon Stewart, however, looked TOTALLY crazy last night. It was really quite scary.

3\) Rob Coburn, you had better hang out with Raluca and I pretty darned soon....

4\) Despite ordering the Python in a Nutshell book, I have semi-officially decided to put off learning Python for a bit. I think that I am going to re-focus my attentions on Scheme, and work my way through the Little Schemer, [The Scheme Programming Language](http://www.scheme.com/tspl3/), and [SICP](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/).  I've been through some of them, but haven't gotten to the end of any of them.

5\) The Giants won! Beat the Bucs, and are going to play the Cowboys next week. I hate the Cowboys, so this is going to be a big deal. I'll probably try to watch it.

6\) [Steve](http://stevedockery.com), congrats on the potential new-old gig!
