Latest installment…

- [The Blob](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0051418/) – Pure 60’s cheese (well, technically 1958, but close enough). Not scary, more silly than anything else. I was amazed that at one point, there was 24 minutes of no blobbing. Instead, we were shown a nearly 30 year old McQueen pretending to be a high schooler.Â At least I can say I’ve seen it once.
- [Hellbound: Hellraiser II](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095294/) – I had heard (multiple times) that this lived up to, if not surpassed, the original.Â I didn’t quite think that was true.Â \[spoiler\] I didn’t like Pinhead reverting to a human and dying.Â A hero has an air of invincibility, and a super-villain (from hell no less) should be the same.Â The plot set him up against the true villain of this movie, and Pinhead lost.Â What a shame.Â That said, it was immensely psychological, and quite a captivating movie (we were all watching with baited breath throughout). I thought it was terrific, just not as good as the first.
- [Dead Alive](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103873/) – What can you say about a movie like that? Tons of gore and grossness, with only a hint of a plot. It is indeed a "classic.” Did I like it?Â Ehh, it was ok… but I can appreciate it, especially viewed through the eyes of others.
