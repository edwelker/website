I created a fresh installation and played around with it for a little while. Upon moving these WordPress posts over, it broke. Since I still had all of my pieces lined up, I removed everything and did a second fresh install. Posting broke that one too. I guess that I am going to have to actually watch the videos on the website to figure out what is going on. (I hate having to read the manual! I'd much rather just start playing with it.)

That being said, it did seem pretty nice. Looks like little pieces of html/css can be specified for each component you are placing on the page. True to their what I have heard, you can customize everything this way. The downside is it takes a lot of work and planning to customize EVERYTHING. Add to that the [{template syntax}](http://expressionengine.com/docs/quick_reference.html) and it looks like quite a bit of work. We'll see how much time I have given all of the other stuff I am working on.

I placed an order today and should receive $200 worth of books from amazon sometime soon. [Programming](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/BTLS/), [OOP](http://archive.eiffel.com/doc/oosc/), [design](http://books.google.com/books?id=V9UggL60zDMC&dq=design+for+communication+resnick&printsec=frontcover&source=web&ots=BAncFWOgub&sig=ctgpjJne3kjZsruXzjqLG-1iTXs), and [typography](http://www.typebooks.org/r-elements.htm), and [that Microformats book](http://microformats.org/). Those, and the other books sitting on my shelves waiting to be read should be more than enough light reading for a while.
