Summer was ending so I decided to move. Ok, not really, it was simply time.

I've moved back to my parent's house in Laurel, MD... which is exceptionally close to Columbia, MD. I've moved into my parents house in an attempt to save some money, I want to clean it and restore it, while putting my would-be rent money into the property taxes here.

The move wasn't difficult in and of itself, but tied with the work that needed (and still needs) to be done at the house, it has been quite an undertaking. I have so much to do it's quite overwhelming.

All of that mess aside, I am looking forward to getting back to study.
