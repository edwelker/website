I don’t typically link to other blogs/articles, nor do I mention classical music particularly often, but I found this article and blog entry so interesting and thought-provoking that they deserve a re-post.

First, [a moving blog entry](http://davidfinlayson.typepad.com/fin_notes/2008/12/some-words-about-gilbert-kaplan.html) from [David Finlayson](http://nyphil.org/meet/orchestra/index.cfm?page=profile&personNum=14), trombonist in the New York Philharmonic, and second, the [New York Times article](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/18/arts/music/18kapl.html?_r=1&hp) describing the background, as well as referencing the [blog post](http://davidfinlayson.typepad.com/fin_notes/2008/12/some-words-about-gilbert-kaplan.html).

While I’ve never had a specifically parallel experience, I can relate to the concepts of "fakes” in a particular industry.Â I find Mr. Finlayson’s reaction (that all musicians must take responsibility and blame for the situation) to be both bold, yet… well, correct.Â It takes a strong person to identify a stormy situation clearly and react in an appropriate fashion.Â I only hope that I would react the same way given the circumstanses.
