As you might have noticed, I’ve been a bit pre-occupied recently. And likely will be so in the future. So a design for this site has once again been placed on the back burner. I am good for a tweak-ing, however.

Looks fine in Firefox 2 for mac/pc. Opera, has a small problem, I think due to a varied em interpretation (it’s different on each platform). I tried IE6, and of course, things were missing, but the design as a whole stood up. So a few "non-lazy" changes should do the trick. Having only spent 30 minutes and using :before and :after pseudo attributes, I was surprised IE didn’t send my PC up in flames.

It just occurs to me, it would be nice if I could add a little javascript (for fun, not practical usage). Not sure what I would add it to, however. Oh well, placed on my to-do list after the real design.
