I have no time for anything!

This is how I usually feel. There are so many things in the world that I want to do/know about, and yet they all take time to do/learn. I don’t have any big to-dos that eat large chunks of my time either… I work, I have my orchestra, I eat, and I relax. I try to use relaxation time for learning/discovery (when I can, of course). It is just very hard. I haven’t taken an analytical approach to the problem yet, but I think I should sometime soon (of course, that may take a while to get to.)

I don’t often rely on calendars, I may have to start. I don’t feel like people ‘rob’ me of time, but I think I should pay attention to that. And of course, I am always trying to make my learning/doing time more efficient (that’s the only thing I have down pat).

Ok, enough rant. Now just a little tip-of-the-hat to what I’ve missed recently… the [FringeDC Meeting](http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/452984/), the [Refresh DC Happy Hour](http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/460659/), the first [Refresh Baltimore Meeting](http://www.refreshbmore.org/) AND [planning group](http://groups.google.com/group/refresh-baltimore-planning), as well as my books, especially the Web Navigation, RESTful Services, Graph Theory, and Discrete Math books!Â (This is not to mention the projects I’d like to get started!)

Maybe I’ll just win the lottery. That may buy me some more time.
