Though [All City ceased this year](https://theradavist.com/all-city-cycles-closing), my All City Dusty Rose Space Horse is still my favorite current bike. I've done three tours of the GAP/C&O, one of the Erie Canal, and many shorter adventures on it.  It fits me like a glove.

### Setup Notes & Customizations

There are a few specific tweaks I made to this build to get the fit and gearing just right:

* Gearing: for climbing, I throw a 36 cassette in back.  For general touring, a 32 is preferred.
* Crankset Mods: I am running a [28-tooth Spécialités TA chainring](https://specialites-ta.com/double/442-1816-double-plateau-gravel-specialites-ta-x80-grx-2-10-11-12v-interieur-specialites-ta-pl480801g9.html#/11,denture,28-dts). The RX800 crank is lighter, and I shaved down the chain slip guide to fit the inner chainring.
* Fit Data:
    * Saddle Setup: 9% angle on the non-drive side; phone aligned with the nose.
    * Stem: I am using the 70mm / 17-degree version of the Shimano PRO LT.
* Cabling:
    * Brake Housing: Shimano Hydro
    * Shift Housing: Jagwire LEX-SL Black
