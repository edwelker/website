I love this bike, it's been on three straight years of the GAP/C&O, the Eire Canal, and multiple other rides.  It fits me like a glove.

### Setup Notes & Customizations

There are a few specific tweaks I made to this build to get the fit and gearing just right:

* Gearing Logic: The cassette is currently a SunRace 11-32t, which was chosen specifically for the C&O/GAP gearing. I have a Sunrace 11-36t available (better gear ratios near 2:1 and 3 extra low gears in the big rings), as well as a Shimano XT CS-M771-10 (11-34 and 36) in the parts bin.
* Crankset Mods: I am running a [28-tooth Spécialités TA chainring](https://specialites-ta.com/double/442-1816-double-plateau-gravel-specialites-ta-x80-grx-2-10-11-12v-interieur-specialites-ta-pl480801g9.html#/11,denture,28-dts). The RX800 crank is lighter, and I shaved down the chain slip guide to fit the inner chainring.
* Fit Data:
    * Saddle Setup: 9% angle on the non-drive side; phone aligned with the nose.
    * Stem: I am using the 70mm / 17-degree version of the Shimano PRO LT.
* Cabling:
    * Brake Housing: Shimano Hydro
    * Shift Housing: Jagwire LEX-SL Black
