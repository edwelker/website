I moved most of the large items this weekend. I still have a few odds and ends (less than one car-full) left at the house. One more trip, and then one trip to wash the carpets, and I should be fully vacated from the old location, and fully "in" the new. Of course, everything remains in boxes, and finding anything is near impossible (and dangerous if you’ve got to walk over things), but I’m workin’ on it.

I’m mostly just interested in getting back into a regular routine.

On the upside (and on a side-note), the Red Sox beat the A’s tonight, the Yankees lost, and Manny played his first game in the last 24 days. Papi hit a home run… hopefully the Sox are using these last few to secure the division, go for best record in the A.L., and win some "meaningful games" before the playoffs start. Get ready…
