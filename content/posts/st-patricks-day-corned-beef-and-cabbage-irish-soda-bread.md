Fresh parsley  
mustard Seed  
4+ peppercorn mix  
cloves  
juniper berries  
bay leaves (the strongest you can find)  
all spice berries

potatoes (baby, about the size of a tablespoon)  
onion (4+ big onions)  
carrot (5+ medium carrots)  
celery (3+ small stalks, not too much)  
cabbage (a small one... it'll have to be cooked after taking some veggies/broth out, so it can't be too large.)  
corned beef (the larger the better, also try to get a flat cut, not a point cut, ~$10, so x lbs)

1\) put the corned beef in, and add ~2 tsp mustard seed, 1.5 tsp peppercorn mix, 4 cloves, 8 juniper berries, 6 all spice berries, 2 very strong bay leaves or 4+ weak bay leaves), and 2 tablespoons of thyme or maybe a little more).
