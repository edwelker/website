My base recipe for Szechuan noodles (noods)

## Ingredients

Almost all of these are optional.

* ⅓ teaspoon mushroom or other MSG powder (chicken, etc.)
* Chili oil
* Lao Ga Man Chili in Oil & Chili Crisp (More the Chili in oil)
* Garlic (not more than 2 cloves)
* Pepper
* Tahini (⅓ teaspoon) (you can also use standard deeper sesame paste here)
* Any amount of dried peppers to taste (but use less “Danshan” type chili/fennel than usual)
* Optional ⅓ teaspoon Chinese vinegar
* Sugar to taste (it should be warming, and sugar is not optional)
* Chinese five spice
* 1 teaspoon Chinese soy sauce
* Salt to taste

## Process

1. Compose the components above into a bowl
2. Cook the noods
3. Ladle about ⅓ or ½ of a cup of the noodle cooking water over the mix to cook the raw (garlic mostly)
4. Mix
