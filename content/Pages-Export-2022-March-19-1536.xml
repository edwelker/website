		<Content><![CDATA[Part programmer, cellist, biker, and photographer, I live in the suburbs of Maryland.Â  Weee!Â  I work at the <a title="National Center for Biotechnology Information" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov">NCBI at NIH</a>, and pass the rest of the time reading, rooting for the Red Sox, and riding my bike.

I work in the... some group (the name keeps changing, and I've never gotten it straight) at the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov">National Center for Biotechnology Information</a> at the <a title="National Institues of Health" href="http://www.nih.gov/">National Institutes of Health</a> in <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;time=&amp;date=&amp;ttype=&amp;q=Bethesda,+MD&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;z=12&amp;iwloc=addr&amp;om=0">Bethesda, Maryland</a>. What do I do?  Well, I mainly do web programming, and yes, I work on <a href="http://pubmed.gov">PubMed</a>. A lot.  My websites get about 3 million hits a day, and that makes me happy.Â   I've previously worked in C++, Perl, Python, and Ruby.  I am fascinated by graphic design, machine learning, typography, and math, what a combo.  I'm a bookworm, and read all the books on these subjects (and more!) that I can get my hands on.  I am also a programming language geek... I play with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)">Scheme</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eiffel_%28programming_language%29">Eiffel</a>, Lisp, and other languages I can learn from.

<a title="Me in front of the Lincoln Center fountain by eddie.welker, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ed_welker/2109275877/"><img class="alignleft" style="margin: 10px 10px 10px 0px;" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2399/2109275877_a5f83c80a0_m.jpg" alt="Me in front of the Lincoln Center fountain" width="180" height="240" /></a>My side projects are many, and most are never seen by eyes other than my own.  I like to toy around Django, Python, Javascript, and Scheme.

I've played the cello since fourth grade, and am principal cellist of the <a title="The Columbia Orchestra" href="http://columbiaorchestra.org">Columbia Orchestra</a>.  I love music (of almost all genres) and enjoy to listen/play/read about music history.  My favorite cellist has always been Mstislav Rostropovich, and I am especially fond of 20thâ€“century Russian composers like Prokofiev, Shostakovich, and Miaskovsky.  I used to be a member of the University of Maryland and <a title="Greater Baltimore Youth Orchestra" href="http://gbyo.com">Greater Baltimore Youth Orchestra</a>s.

I'm an avid <a title="Boston Red Sox" href="http://boston.com/redsox/">Red Sox</a> fan who grew up watching them during the summers I spent at my grandparents house.  I'm told the only thing I say during games is "Come on Man-ny!"

My basement is filled with a fleet of 8 bicycles (currently), 4 fixed gears, 3 road, and one old mountain.  I love riding, and go whenever I can, rain or shine, in the hot or extreme cold.

I'm a photo geek as well.  My dad was a big Olympus fan, so I chose that brand to use all of the lenses that were around. I'm still relatively new to this, but try to get better with every picture I take. I now use a combination of an Olympus E-520, and my baby, my Nikon D700.

I'm using wordpress hopefully because it will make things easier for me, until I foolishly decide it's time to break the cardinal sin, and develop my own blog from scratch.]]></Content>
