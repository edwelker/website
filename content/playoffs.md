The Red Sox start the playoffs tomorrow at Fenway against the Angels. I will be rooting for them (as always), but with added urgency since I have the chance to go to Game 2 of the ALCS, when they advance. ðŸ™‚

Getting tickets is rather unpleasant, but I managed them somehow.

Guess Iâ€™ll have to start planning a trip to Boston.
